We invite\n                            developers to use our API and provide feedback.\n\n\nEbook Catalog API\nThe Office of the Historian Ebook Catalog API is a\n                            RESTful, OPDS-formatted catalog of the growing number of free ebooks from the\n                                Foreign Relations of the United States series. Use this API to embed\n                            our live, up-to-date, searchable, and browsable ebook catalog in your application\n                            and to locate download links to the ebooks and their cover images.\n\n\nSupport\nDevelopers are welcome to visit our organizational account on GitHub. Requests or inquiries may\n                            be submitted as issues.\n\n\nTechnologies & Standards\nThis website is powered by eXist-db, a free, open\n                            source XML server and the open standard W3C technologies it supports, including\n                            XQuery 3.0, EXPath, and EXQuery.\nOur digitization initiatives center around the Text\n                                Encoding Initiative (TEI), an open, mature, XML-based standard used widely\n                            in libraries and the humanities. All our article- and book-length content is encoded\n                            as TEI. A single digital master TEI file can store an entire FRUS volume.\n                            We store this TEI in eXist-db and convert it to TEI into HTML or ebook forms using\n                            XQuery.\nOur ebook catalog API uses the Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS), an Atom\n                            XML-based standard for encoding ebook catalogs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\nEbook Catalog API\n\neXist-db\n\nText Encoding Initiative (TEI)\n\nProject on GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
