These conferences                        typically aim to bring together former diplomats and policymakers with respected scholars of                        U.S. foreign relations. The Office of the Historian has also been successful in including                        current policymakers in these conferences. These conferences are generally open to the                        public, although pre-registration might be required.Past ConferencesNational Security Policy and                                SALT I, 1969-1972Foreign Relations of the United States Special Conference SeriesMarch 2-3,                            2012 Foreign Economic Policy,                                1973-1976Foreign Relations of the United States Special Conference SeriesMarch 7,                            2011 The American Experience in Southeast Asia,                                1946-1975 September 29\u201330, 2010 U.S.-Soviet Relations in the Era of D\u00e9tente,                                1969-1976 October 22\u201323, 2007 Transforming the Cold War: The United States                                and China, 1969-1980September 25\u201327, 2006 The Office of the Historian also participates in other events and forums relating to the                        history of U.S. foreign relations and the Foreign Relations of the United States                            series.
