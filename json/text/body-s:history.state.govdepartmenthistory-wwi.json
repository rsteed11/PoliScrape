In contrast to the well known record of U.S. actions after it\n                    entered the war in April 1917, the stories of U.S. diplomats, consuls, and their family\n                    members\u2014particularly during the early months of the crisis (August-December 1914)\u2014were long\n                    forgotten, overshadowed by subsequent events of the tumultuous twentieth century. By\n                    researching U.S. Government and Government of France records, memoirs, personal papers, and\n                    newspaper archives, this study presents a fascinating account of how actions spearheaded by\n                    U.S. diplomats\u2014and American citizens\u2014significantly strengthened Franco-American relations in\n                    unique, unparalleled ways.\n\nDownload PDF (818 KB)\n\n\nThe Office of the Historian has released this electronic preview edition of \u201cViews From the Embassy: The Role of the U.S. Diplomatic Community in France, 1914\u201d\n                    (PDF, 818 KB). Over the upcoming months, this preview edition will be superseded by a more\n                    complete version. The material complements U.S. Embassy France\u2019s WWI Centennial page. Readers\n                    may view full copies of several documents referenced in \u201cViews From the Embassy\u201d through\n                    links on the Embassy\u2019s WWI Interactive Timeline.\nThe material in \u201cViews From the Embassy\u201d differs substantially from documentation printed in the\n                        Foreign Relations of the United States volumes covering World War I, which\n                    focus upon high policy decisions and matters of international law rather than\n                    on-the-ground operations. Readers may access Foreign Relations of the United\n                        States volumes, such as the 1914 War Supplement\n                        volume, through the Office of the Historian website.\n\nThe Office of the Historian is grateful to the following institutions that provided\n                    assistance on this project: The American Hospital in Paris; The American Chamber of Commerce\n                    in Paris; Columbia Center for Oral History Collection, Columbia University (Reminiscences of\n                    DeWitt Clinton Poole Jr.); Harvard University Archives, Harvard University (Robert &\n                    Mildred Bliss Papers); Moorland-Springarn Research Center, Howard University (William H.\n                    Hunt Papers); The Sheridan Libraries Special Collections, The Johns Hopkins University (John\n                    Work Garrett Papers); Western Reserve Historical Society (Myron T.
