The basic objective of these essays is to\n                    provide a clear, accurate, narrative account of the events being discussed, with a brief\n                    discussion of each event\u2019s significance for U.S. foreign policy and diplomatic history. The\n                    publication is divided into 19 chapters covering time periods from 1750 until 2000,\n                    with brief introductions providing context for each period.\n\n\nSelect a period:\n1750\u20131775\n                                \n1776\u20131783\n                                \n1784\u20131800\n                                \n1801\u20131829\n                                \n1830\u20131860\n                                \n1861\u20131865\n                                \n1866\u20131898\n                                \n1899\u20131913\n                                \n1914\u20131920\n                                \n1921\u20131936\n                                \n1937\u20131945\n                                \n1945\u20131952\n                                \n1953\u20131960\n                                \n1961\u20131968\n                                \n1969\u20131976\n                                \n1977\u20131980\n                                \n1981\u20131988\n                                \n1989\u20131992\n                                \n1993\u20132000\n                                \n\n\nThe essays were drafted for the Office of the Historian website by many historians over many\n                    years, and we continue to revise and expand the existing periods. Most recently, the essays\n                    covering the Kennedy and Johnson (1961\u201368), Nixon and Ford (1969\u201376), Carter (1977\u201380), Reagan (1981\u201388), Bush (1989\u201392), and Clinton (1993\u20132000) administrations were revised and\n                    expanded. These same essays were also enhanced with \u201ctags,\u201d or lists of the key people,\n                    places, and topics in the essay. The tags appear as links in the right sidebar of the essay\n                    and facilitate discovery of other other essays and resources, including volumes from the\n                        Foreign Relations of the United States series, on these subjects. The \u201ctags\u201d\n                    feature is still in progress, and over time the Office will extend the tags to all of the\n                    essays.\nTo begin, select a period from the sidebar, or view a list of all milestones.\nLast updated: November 1, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilestones\n\n\n1750-1775\n\n1776-1783\n\n1784-1800\n\n1801-1829\n\n1830-1860\n\n1861-1865\n\n1866-1898\n\n1866-1898\n\n1899-1913\n\n1914-1920\n\n1921-1936\n\n1937-1945\n\n1945-1952\n\n1953-1960\n\n1961-1968\n\n1969-1976\n\n1977-1980\n\n1981-1988\n\n1989-1992\n\n1993-2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
