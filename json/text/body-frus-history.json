Raymond L. Garthoff, senior fellow at the Brookings\n                Institution, and former member of the SALT negotiating team.\nThe Strategic Arms Limitation Talks produced a series of comprehensive arms control\n                agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union that for the first time\n                limited the deployment of ballistic missiles and anti-ballistic missile systems.\n                Commonly referred to as \u201cSALT I,\u201d the agreements were signed by President Richard\n                Nixon and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev at the Moscow\n                Summit in May 1972. This volume documents the negotiations leading up to the\n                agreement, the internal deliberations among U.S. policy makers, and reveals the play\n                of political and national security considerations that factored into U.S.\n                negotiating positions and policy decisions.\nTim McDonnell, program associate in the Wilson Center's Nuclear Proliferation\n                International History Project will chair the event.\n\n\n\n\u201cDiplomatic Secrecy in the 19th Century\u201d\n\n A panel discussion at the Wilson CenterDecember 8, 2011, 4-5:30 p.m.\nWhile the formal classification system used to keep sensitive government information secret was a 20th Century development, even in the 19th Century, new research shows, the Department of State had to balance the \u201cpublic\u2019s right to know\u201d with protecting national interests. Foreign policy documents were often released soon after events took place, sometimes complicating diplomatic relations. In certain instances sensitive documents and information were withheld, usually in the name of national security, but occasionally for political advantage. Congress, the media, public audiences, and other governments all took an interest in this peculiarly American penchant for walking the tightrope between transparency of governmental operations and withholding information \"not in the public interest.\"\n\u201cDiplomatic Secrecy in the 19th Century\u201d will explore the earliest available examples of both America's open and secret diplomacy, as well as how the ad-hoc system used in the 19th Century formed the basis for the formalized system which was developed in later years.\nPanel participants: Aaron Marrs, Peter Cozzens, and William B. McAllister.\n\n\n\n\u201cCelebrating 150 Years of FRUS at Lincoln\u2019s Cottage\u201d\n\n A presentation at President Lincoln\u2019s CottageDecember 1, 2011, 6:30-7:30 p.m.\nPresident Lincoln\u2019s Cottage and the Office of the Historian of the U.S. Department of State are hosting a public program to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS), the flagship publication of the Department\u2019s Office of the Historian.

As part of the sesquicentennial anniversary of the series, the Office of\n                the Historian at the U.S. Department of State launched a special research initiative\n                to explore the history of FRUS.

The evolution of the series during the twentieth century, particularly\n                debates in the 1950s surrounding the release of the 1945 Yalta Conference volume\n                (and those covering other wartime conferences), illuminates historical debates\n                within the United States Government over secrecy versus transparency in the\n                realm of diplomacy and national security and tensions between Congress and the\n                Executive Branch in conducting foreign policy. Dr. Josh Botts of the Department\n                of State\u2019s Office of the Historian and Susan Butler, distinguished historian and\n                biographer, will discuss how the story of the Yalta FRUS volume\n                reflected the interplay of partisan impulses, national security imperatives, and\n                bureaucratic politics in the 1950s.\nUpdate: An audio recording of this event is available from the NYPL homepage.\n\n\n\n\u201cFRUS In\n                    The World, Part One: New Research on the Foreign Relations of the United\n                        States series, The Long Nineteenth Century\u201d\n\n A panel at the Society\n                for Historians of American Foreign Relations Annual MeetingJune 24, 2011 \n\n\nChair \nWilliam B.

The most\n                significant results of this research will be revealed in the two sessions we\n                propose to present at the 2011 SHAFR annual meeting. Why was the series launched\n                in 1861, and how was it shaped by previous public releases of foreign policy\n                documents? Why did the series continue after its ostensible reason for\n                publication, the Civil War, ended? What controversies surrounded the compilation\n                and publication of the series in the later 19th century? This panel will shed\n                important new light on multiple aspects of 19th century U.S. history and\n                historiography, including relations between the legislative and executive\n                branches, conceptions about \u201copenness in government\u201d in a nineteenth-century\n                context, issues of professional expertise and politicization involved in\n                producing FRUS volumes, and important foreign policy issues of the era. In order\n                to explore this topic thoroughly, we anticipate that each presenter will speak\n                for 30 minutes, followed by substantial remarks from the two commentators, with\n                sufficient time reserved for the audience to participate in a larger discussion\n                of the issues raised. \n\n\u201cPublicizing Foreign\n                        Relations in Time of War: The Foundation of the Foreign Relations of the\n                        United States Series\u201d\n\nAaron W. Marrs\nAn examination of early Foreign Relations of the United States volumes gives\n                    us an opportunity to investigate how the federal government presented its\n                    foreign policy to the American people, and how the populace reacted to\n                    foreign policy. Using the volumes themselves, Department of State documents,\n                    and private papers, this paper will demonstrate that FRUS was composed for a\n                    domestic (not international) audience and constitutes an example of the\n                    federal balance of powers. This paper will shed light on FRUS\u2019s early\n                    history, contrast the volumes with the ad hoc publications which preceded\n                    them, and explore the contemporary implications of its publication. \n\n\n\u201cCharming Volumes for Summer Outings\u201d: FRUS and the Transformation of\n                    American Foreign Policy, 1870-1900\nPeter Cozzens\nThis paper will examine the role the FRUS series played during the\n                    transformative years of American Foreign Policy from 1870-1900. It will\n                    place especial emphasis on Congressional, public, and foreign reception of\n                    the series and the series\u2019 impact on American foreign policy and\n                    transparency in government. Also examined will be the quality and\n                    completeness of the volumes, particularly with respect to salient policy\n                    issues and crises.

It\n                    not only sparked intense public controversy upon its 1955 release, but it\n                    also represented the culmination of the professionalization of FRUS that\n                    began in the 1920s and introduced methodological changes that transformed\n                    the compilation and scope of the FRUS series during the postwar period. The\n                    paper uses Department of State and Congressional records, personal\n                    manuscript collections, and newspapers to examine issues of domestic and\n                    bureaucratic politics, diplomacy, and national security as FRUS entered the\n                    Cold War era. \n\n\n\u201cThe War of Documents\u201d and the Professionalization of the Editor\u2019s Work: A\n                    Comparative View\nSacha Zala\nThis paper will place the FRUS series in comparative international\n                    perspective by examining similar issues that have arisen in European\n                    official publications of foreign policy documents. Topics will include how\n                    the FRUS series impacted, and was impacted by, the \u201cWar Guilt Controversy\u201d\n                    of the 1920s; controversies surrounding the publication of FRUS volumes on\n                    the Paris Peace Conferences; the use of captured German records as a Cold\n                    War propaganda tool; and general observations about developing professional\n                    standards for historians and government employees surrounding the use and\n                    release of sensitive foreign policy documents. \n\n\n\n\u201cCrisis\n                    and Change in the Foreign Relations of the United States Series,\n                    1861-2011\u201d\n\n A panel at the Society\n                for History in the Federal Government Annual MeetingMarch 31, 2011\n\n\nChair \nWilliam B.

The Department of State\u2019s Office of the Historian, which\n                publishes the FRUS series, is conducting significant new research about the\n                historical development of the series. To commemorate the FRUS sesquicentennial,\n                we propose to share the most significant early results of this research at the\n                2011 SHFG Annual Conference. This panel will shed important new light on\n                multiple aspects of 18th through 20th century history and historiography,\n                including pre-1861 releases of foreign policy documents, relations between the\n                legislative and executive branches, conceptions about \u201copenness in government\u201d\n                in a 19th century context, the growing professionalization of both historians\n                and the Foreign Service, the tension between the rising status of the United\n                States in world affairs and the desire to promote informed public debate through\n                release of foreign policy documents, the international ramifications of\n                revelations that have an impact on other governments, and evolving political\n                factors that have shaped and continue to shape the compilation and publication\n                of FRUS volumes. We also envision allotting sufficient time after the\n                presentations to engage in question-and-answer and general discussion with the\n                audience about issues of interest to them. \n\n\n\n\u201cForeign Economic Policy,\n                    1973-1976\u201d\n\n Inaugural conference of the FRUS Special Conference SeriesMarch 31, 2011\nAs part of an array of events designed to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series, the State Department\u2019s Office of the Historian is inaugurating the FRUS Special Conference Series to highlight recently-published FRUS volumes.\nOn March 7th, the Office of the Historian and the George Mason University School of Public Policy will host a half-day conference focused on the FRUS volume dealing with Foreign Economic Policy, 1973-1976.
