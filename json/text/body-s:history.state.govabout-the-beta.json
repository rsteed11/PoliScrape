In order to gather feedback and work out any remaining kinks, we are sharing the new site in \u201cbeta\u201d\u2014or preview form. Please have a                        look around and send us your suggestions via email at                        history@state.gov or on Twitter at                        @HistoryAtState.Features of the New VersionA mobile device-friendly \u201cresponsive\u201d design: Adapts to the size of your device and                            is readable on any screen size, from smart phone to desktop. (On a computer,                            try making your browser window smaller, or, on a mobile device, try changing your screen\u2019s                            orientation; notice how the elements of the page adapt to the new size.) The new design                            is aligned with U.S. Web Design                                Standards.                        A fluid reading experience: Quickly advance forward or backward in publications                            such as the Foreign Relations series. To try this out, visit this document and select the                            \u201cprevious\u201d or \u201cnext\u201d arrows to the left and right of the document window.                        Improved security: Your connection to the beta site\u2014and all of history.state.gov\u2014is now encrypted.                            This setting, called HSTS, forces all connections to the site to use a secure, HTTPS                            connection, ensuring the integrity of the pages you visit and preventing others from                            tracking which pages you visit or what terms you search for. For more on this standard                            and its adoption by U.S. Government websites, see https.cio.gov.                        Improved stability and performance: We have rewritten                            the entire site from scratch with the goal of delivering results faster                            and sustaining heavier traffic. The new site is also running on multiple                            servers in multiple data centers for improved performance under load.Open data, open source code: All of the content and code on this site is                            available for anyone to download. The core data repositories                            are available at HistoryAtState on GitHub. The web application is available at the hsg-shell repository.
