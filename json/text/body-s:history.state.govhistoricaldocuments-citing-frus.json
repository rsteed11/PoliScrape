Your style guide may require\n                    different formatting of a citation, so you may need to adapt the elements of the sample\n                    citations below to a specific format.\nCite document numbers rather than page numbers\nEvery document in the Foreign Relations series since the 1955\u201357 subseries has been\n                    assigned a sequential number unique within the volume. The advantage of citing a Foreign\n                        Relations document by its document number is that, unlike page numbers, the numbers\n                    are media neutral and remain consistent across different media: print, web, and ebook. An\n                    example of a citation to document number is as follows:\nForeign Relations\n                        of the United States, 1969\u20131976, Volume XIX, Part 1, Korea, 1969\u20131972, eds. Daniel\n                    J. Lawler and Erin R. Mahan (Washington: Government Printing Office, 2010), Document\n                    75.\nThe components of this citation are as follows:\n\nSeries title: Foreign Relations of the United States\n\nSubseries title: 1969\u20131976\nVolume number: Volume XIX, Part 1\nVolume title: Korea, 1969\u20131972\nEditors (not to include the General Editor): Daniel J. Lawler and Erin R. Mahan\nCity: Washington, D.C.\nPublisher: Government Printing Office\nYear published: 2010\nLocation within the volume: Document 75\n\nCite volumes by URL\nParticularly if you consulted the web or ebook edition of a Foreign Relations\n                    volume, we recommend appending the canonic URL for the volume (or document) to your\n                    reference. This will allow readers to directly access the source. Taking the previous\n                    citation as an example, the following URL would be appended to the end of the citation,\n                    often including a date the material was accessed:\nhttp://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v19p1/d75 [accessed 27 Oct\n                    2011]\nURLs to Foreign Relations documents always follow this structure: the Office of the\n                    Historian\u2019s website domain (\u201chttp://history.state.gov\u201d), section (\u201chistoricaldocuments\u201d),\n                    volume identifier (\u201cfrus1969-76v19p1\u201d), and document identifier (\u201cd75\u201d).\nA scanned image of the original printed page (or scanned document, in the case of certain electronic-only\n                    volumes) is available for citation by URL. You can find these URLs in the right sidebar of\n                    each document, labeled \"View Image.\" For example, the sidebar for document 75 contains links to\n                    the images of pages 190, 191, and 192. Notice that in these\n                    page-number-based URLs, the document identifier (\u201cd75\u201d) is substituted with the page number\n                    identifier (\u201cpg_190\u201d, etc.).\nCitations to ebook editions are no different for these examples.\nWhen citing a document number is not possible\nSince volumes before the 1955\u201357 subseries did not include document numbers, citations must\n                    reference page numbers:\nForeign Relations\n                        of the United States, 1952\u20131954, General: Economic and Political Matters, Volume I,\n                    Part 1, eds. David M. Baehler, Herbert A. Fine, Ralph R. Goodwin, N. Stephen Kane, Ronald D.\n                    Landa, Lisle A. Rose, William F. Sanford, Jr., and Ilana M. Stern (Washington: Government\n                    Printing Office, 1983), 798\u2013800.\nDocument numbers have been superimposed on the web and ebook edition of all these earlier\n                    volumes that have been digitized, so that every document has a unique URL. But take caution\n                    that readers of the print edition will not be able to locate a citation in these volumes by\n                    document number (e.g., the web edition of the above citation appears as \u201cDocument 221\u201d). \nVariations in the titles of early Foreign Relations volumes\nEarly editions of the Foreign Relations series used a variety of titles. For\n                    example:\nPapers Relating\n                        to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1918, Russia, Volume III\n                    (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1932), 51.\nPapers Relating\n                        to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1893 (Washington: Government\n                    Printing Office, 1894), 452\u2013453.\nMessage of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the\n                        Commencement of the Third Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress (Washington:\n                    Government Printing Office, 1862), 356\u2013370.\n(For more information on the titles, see the discussion of the term \u201cForeign\n                        Relations series\u201d in the history of the Foreign Relations series.)\nAlso, earlier volumes typically do not identify the editors, in which case the names of\n                    editors can not be included in a citation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Documents\n\n\nBrowse official documents from the published Foreign Relations of the United States series.\n\n\nBrowse by Administration\n\n\nPre-Truman Volumes\n\nTruman Administration\n\nEisenhower Administration\n\nKennedy Administration\n\nJohnson Administration\n\nNixon Administration\n\nFord Administration\n\nCarter Administration\n\nReagan Administration\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Resources\n\n\nMore about\n                            the Foreign Relations series\n\nStatus of the Series\n\nHistory of the Series\n\nForeign Relations Ebooks\n\nOther Electronic Resources for\n                            U.S. Foreign Relations\n\nGuide to Sources on\n                            Vietnam, 1969-1975\n\nTips for searching the Foreign Relations Series\n\nHow to cite Foreign Relations documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
