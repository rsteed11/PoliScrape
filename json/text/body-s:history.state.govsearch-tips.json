All searches are case-insensitive, so searching for \u201cSALT\u201d will\n                    return the same results as searching for \u201csalt.\u201d You can refine a query by (1) narrowing its\n                    scope to specific sections of the website or to specific Foreign Relations volumes\n                    and (2) using phrase, boolean, wildcard, and proximity operators in your search. Use the\n                    following techniques and syntax to improve your search results. Click on each example to\n                    pre-fill the search form with the parameters of your search, and then submit the search to\n                    see the results.\n* Note that the search engine\u2019s results are limited to the materials that the Office of the\n                    Historian has digitized. Please consult the full list of Foreign Relations volumes\n                        by administration to see which volumes have been\n                    digitized (indicated by the phrase, \u201cfull text,\u201d next to each volume\u2019s title), and consult\n                    the University of Wisconsin Madison\n                            FRUS collection or a library near you for access to volumes not yet\n                    available here.\n\nScope\nBeneath the keyword search field is a set of checkboxes. Selecting any of the checkboxes\n                        can narrow the scope of your search, resulting in a faster, more specific query. The\n                        default set of checkboxes contains the major content sections of the website: Historical\n                        Documents, Department History, Milestones, Countries, Conferences, Educational\n                        Resources, FRUS Sesquicentennial, and About (FAQ, Advisory Committee Minutes). You can\n                        also select specific Foreign Relations volumes. To search for articles about\n                        U.S. diplomatic history that relate to peace:\npeace (with the \u201cDepartment History\u201d and \u201cMilestones\u201d checkboxes selected) \nIf no checkboxes are selected, the entire site will be searched. To achieve the best\n                        results, combine scope with the following search operators:\n\n\nPhrases\nWhen you type your search terms into the box, the search engine will search for those\n                        terms, individually, anywhere in a document. To force the search engine to find fixed\n                        phrases (i.e., specific, ordered combinations of words), place the phrase in quotation\n                        marks. To locate documents which include both \u201cpeaceful\u201d and \u201cnuclear\u201d anywhere in the\n                        text, use the following search:\npeaceful nuclear\n\nTo locate documents which use the phrase \u201cpeaceful nuclear,\u201d use this search:\n\"peaceful nuclear\"\n\n\n\nBooleans\nThe search engine will allow you to perform Boolean searches (AND, OR, and NOT). Boolean\n                        operators must be in all caps.\nYou can use Boolean operators with individual terms or with phrases enclosed in quotation\n                        marks. For example, to locate documents which include both the word \u201cKissinger\u201d and the\n                        phrase \u201cpeaceful nuclear,\u201d use this search:\nKissinger AND\n                            \"peaceful nuclear\"\n\nTo locate documents which include either \u201cRhodesia\u201d or \u201cZimbabwe,\u201d use this search:\nRhodesia OR Zimbabwe\n\nTo locate documents which include the phrase \u201carms control\u201d but exclude documents which\n                        also include the term \u201cSALT,\u201d use this search:\n\"arms control\" NOT SALT\n\nYou can also use the plus (+) and minus (-) signs to include or exclude certain terms. To\n                        search for documents which must include the phrase \u201claw of the sea\u201d and may include the\n                        term \u201cseabed,\u201d use this search:\n+\"law of the sea\" seabed\n\nTo search for documents which include \u201cKorea\u201d but not \u201cDMZ,\u201d use this search:\nKorea -DMZ\n\nFinally, you can use parentheses to nest your searches. To find documents which include\n                        \u201cGuatemala\u201d or \u201cEl Salvador\u201d and \u201cBelize,\u201d use this search:\n(Guatemala OR\n                            \"El Salvador\") AND Belize\n\n\n\nWildcards\nIf you are unsure about the spelling of a term or want to find variants of a term, you\n                        can use wildcards. The search engine supports two wildcard characters: ? and *.\nIf you want to replace a single letter in your search term, use ? in your query. To find\n                        documents which include \u201ctext\u201d or \u201ctest,\u201d use this search:\nte?t\n\nNote that the above search will not return hits for \u201cTet\u201d or \u201cteapot.\u201d If you want to\n                        replace zero or more letters in your search term use * in your query. For example, to\n                        find documents which include \u201cVietnam\u201d and \u201cVietnamese,\u201d use this search:\nVietna*\n\nNote that the above search will not return hits for \u201cViet Nam,\u201d another spelling of the\n                        same country. You may have to try multiple variants of the same search to get all the\n                        results you need.\n\n\nProximity\nIf you are searching for common words, you can tell the search engine to only return\n                        documents in which the words are within a distance you define. To find documents which\n                        include \u201cCuba\u201d and \u201csubmarine\u201d within 10 words of each other, use this search:\n\"Cuba submarine\"~10\n\nWe are aware that \u201ckeyword in context\u201d summary of the results of proximity searches are\n                        not displaying correctly. The search results themselves, however, are reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
