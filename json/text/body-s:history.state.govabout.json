The Office\u2019s historians work closely with other federal government\n                            history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the\n                            globe. The Office is directed by Dr. Stephen\n                                Randolph, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.\n\n\nWhat We Do\nThe Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and\n                            publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the\n                            Foreign Relations of the United States series.\nIn addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for\n                            Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential\n                            background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify\n                            precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on\n                            institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make\n                            decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their\n                            choices.
