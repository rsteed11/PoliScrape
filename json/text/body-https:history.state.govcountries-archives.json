This current list is based on\n                        information received from American diplomatic posts abroad, as well as web\n                        sources and communication with the archives themselves. The information provided\n                        here is subject to change so researchers are advised to contact the government\n                        or archive ahead of any planned visit. \nSelect an article from the list of all countries.\nWhile access to the diplomatic records of many countries remains highly\n                        restricted, the news is better than ever before with many new countries\n                        establishing Freedom of Information Acts to foment better government\n                        transparency. \nThe divide between the developed world and the developing world also affects the\n                        state of international archives. Problems of infrastructure inhibit the nature\n                        of information dissemination. The amount of information available on the\n                        internet varies from country to country and many National Archives and\n                        Ministries of Foreign Affairs are still in the process of developing workable\n                        websites.\nThis site does not comment on the state of the records themselves. In addition to\n                        the loss of records as a result of changes of government and civil war, the\n                        climate has wreaked havoc upon some archives, particularly in tropical regions,\n                        whose documents, despite the best efforts of archivists, have been compromised\n                        by heat, humidity, flooding, and frequent power outages.\nIn compiling this database, the Office of the Historian has tried to give\n                        researchers a starting place for their inquiries. We have not included anecdotal\n                        advice on how to approach any given archive. Countries that do not\n                        systematically declassify their documents may require personal contacts to gain\n                        access to records of interest. Additionally, compliance with laws that guide\n                        freedom of information may vary.\nFor the most part, diplomatic records are held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n                        (or a similar department) or have been transferred to a National Archive. If\n                        that is done systematically, it is usually apparent as to which records are\n                        available for viewing. When transfer is not systematic, it is up to the\n                        researcher to discover the location of the documents they wish to view as well\n                        as to make contact with the relevant archivist.\nThe Office of the Historian would be happy to receive updated or missing\n                        information.
