Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers,
                    1945, General: The United Nations, Volume I








Introductory note by the Editor
Historical Note

For documentation on arrangements for exploratory discussions on world
                        security organization (including the Dumbarton Oaks conversations August
                        21–October 7, 1944), see Foreign Relations, 1944, volume I, pages 614 ff.
The Conference of the United Nations was called to meet in San Francisco on
                        April 25, 1945, for the sole purpose of drafting the charter of a world
                        security organization, and concluded on June 26, 1945, after fifty-one days
                        of debate, negotiation, and drafting. The delegates of fifty governments
                        unanimously approved the Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the
                        International Court of Justice, and the “Interim Arrangements” for the
                        establishment of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in plenary
                        session on June 25. On the following day the Charter was signed by 153
                        delegates, and a space was left for the signature of Poland, whose
                        government was not represented at the Conference.
The United States Senate gave advice and consent to ratification of the
                        Charter of the United Nations and annexed Statute of the International Court
                        of Justice on July 28. President Truman ratified the
                        Charter with the Statute on August 8 and signed the United Nations
                        Participation Act of 1945 providing for United States participation in the
                        United Nations on December 20. The Charter came into force on October 24,
                        1945, when the five major powers and twenty-four other signatory states had
                        ratified the Charter. The original Protocol of Deposit of Ratifications of
                        the Charter of the United Nations, signed by Secretary of State
                            James F. Byrnes, was deposited, with the original
                        signed copy of the Charter and the Statute, in the Archives of the
                        Government of the United States.
Conference Structure and
                            Documentation

The Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, supplemented by later agreements, amendments,
                        comments, and proposals submitted by participating [Page 2]governments, constituted the agenda of the Conference. The
                        permanent organization of the Conference comprised four commissions, twelve
                        technical committees, and four general committees. The International
                        Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General of the Conference, provided
                        secretaries and clerical assistance for the committees, as well as
                        translating, documentation, communications, and other facilities for them
                        and the Conference as a whole.
The Charter was drafted in closed meetings of the twelve technical committees
                        and their subcommittees. Recommendations of each committee formulated on the
                        various parts of the agenda assigned to it were submitted on completion of
                        its work to the appropriate commission, and, in turn, each commission, after
                        consideration of the recommendations of its technical committees,
                        recommended to the Conference in plenary session proposed texts for adoption
                        as parts of the Charter. Nearly all of the important records of the
                        Conference were issued in mimeographed form and distributed daily. About
                        half a million sheets were reproduced each day. Documents of the commissions
                        and committees, in general, include agenda, summary reports of meetings, and
                        working documents. Verbatim minutes of the plenary sessions only were freely
                        distributed, although verbatim minutes of other meetings were available for
                        reference.
The principal documents of the United Nations Conference were published by
                        the United Nations Information Organizations (London and New York) in
                        cooperation with the Library of Congress in the 22-volume series entitled
                            Documents of the United Nations Conference on
                            International Organization. The series is available from the United
                        Nations, New York. This material, reproduced photolithographically, without
                        textual editing, from the mimeographed, printed, or photolithographed
                        originals, is presented in the two working languages of the Conference,
                        English and French. The final documents, however, the Charter, Statute of
                        the International Court of Justice, and the Interim Arrangements are
                        presented in the five official languages, Chinese, English, French, Russian,
                        and Spanish. An index covering the complete official documentation is
                        contained in volume 21. This volume provides a chronological legislative
                        history of each article of the Charter, an alphabetical subject key, tables
                        of correspondence between articles of the Charter of the United Nations and
                        the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, and a list of abbreviations used. An
                        explanation of the numbering and classification system for Conference
                        documentation is provided in volume 2 of the series, on pages 19, 27, and
                        31.
Reports of participating governments include the following English versions:
                            Charter of the United Nations: Report to the President
                            on the Results of the San Francisco Conference by the Chairman of the

                        (Wellington, Department of External Affairs, publication No. 11, 1945).
Purpose and Scope of This
                        Compilation

This compilation constitutes a bridge between the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals
                        and the Charter of the United Nations. It concentrates on the role of the
                        United States in establishing the legal framework of the United Nations
                        Organization.
The underlying purpose is to present the American Delegation’s position in
                        relation to the various issues, discussions, and decisions at different
                        levels, such as informal diplomatic meetings, in Conference committees and
                        subcommittees, and informal meetings of individuals, with emphasis on the
                        why and how, and the atmosphere in which agreements were reached informally
                        among the major Powers on the various issues, rather than on what transpired
                        in the formal meetings of the Conference.
The preparation of United States policy recommendations for a general
                        international organization is traced chronologically from the first of the
                        year to completion on May 2, 1945, and issuance in the documentary form of
                        “Changes in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals as Suggested by the United States
                        Delegation”, and on May 4 in the form of “Amendments Proposed by the
                        Governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and
                        China.”
Substantive work of the Conference, which awaited availability of the joint
                        proposals of the Sponsors, began on May 7 with study of the Dumbarton Oaks
                        Proposals and the amendments presented by the Sponsors and other nations at
                        the Conference. From this point on to [Page 4]the signing of the Charter on June 26, the documentation presented herein
                        focuses on four phases of Conference activities: policy development,
                        negotiation, debates, and drafting. The evolution of United States policy on
                        the various subjects may be traced through the minutes of the seventy-nine
                        meetings of the United States Delegation. Informal negotiation outside
                        formal meetings, and coordination of proposed policies of the United States
                        with other major powers, may be traced through minutes of the twelve
                        meetings of the “Big Four” and twenty-nine meetings of the “Big Five”, as
                        well as minutes of a series of informal meetings with representatives of the
                        other American Republics. This documentation, unpublished heretofore, is
                        coordinated with the published documentation on Conference proceedings by
                        use of footnote citations at the appropriate points in order to trace action
                        taken by the American delegates in the various technical committees of the
                        Conference in accordance with the agreed position established within the
                        delegation as a whole for their guidance.
Many of the records of meetings included in this volume were informal notes
                        rather than official verbatim minutes approved by the participants.
Additional selected documentation printed herein includes extracts from the
                        daily record of Secretary of State Stettinius, memoranda of conversations of the Secretary with
                        other delegates, daily reports of the Secretary to the Department on
                        Conference developments, instructions to the Secretary from the Department,
                        Departmental correspondence, memoranda, diplomatic notes, policy statements,
                        and Presidential correspondence.
Occasional deletions of less important data have been made, necessarily,
                        within certain documents to save space but not without indications in the
                        text.
The documents were gathered from the central indexed files and the office and
                        post lot files of the Department of State, as well as from the Manuscript
                        Division of the Library of Congress, from the Department of the Interior,
                        from the United States Mission to the United Nations, from the
                            Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park, New
                        York, and from various Department of State publications.[Page 5]

About the Beta







About the Beta
The Office of the Historian is pleased to present a new version of our public website,
                        history.state.gov. In order to gather feedback and work out any remaining kinks, we are sharing the new site in “beta”—or preview form. Please have a
                        look around and send us your suggestions via email at
                        history@state.gov or on Twitter at
                        @HistoryAtState.
Features of the New Version

A mobile device-friendly “responsive” design: Adapts to the size of your device and
                            is readable on any screen size, from smart phone to desktop. (On a computer,
                            try making your browser window smaller, or, on a mobile device, try changing your screen’s
                            orientation; notice how the elements of the page adapt to the new size.) The new design
                            is aligned with U.S. Web Design
                                Standards.
                        
A fluid reading experience: Quickly advance forward or backward in publications
                            such as the Foreign Relations series. To try this out, visit this document and select the
                            “previous” or “next” arrows to the left and right of the document window.
                        
Improved security: Your connection to the beta site—and all of history.state.gov—is now encrypted.
                            This setting, called HSTS, forces all connections to the site to use a secure, HTTPS
                            connection, ensuring the integrity of the pages you visit and preventing others from
                            tracking which pages you visit or what terms you search for. For more on this standard
                            and its adoption by U.S. Government websites, see https.cio.gov.
                        
Improved stability and performance: We have rewritten
                            the entire site from scratch with the goal of delivering results faster
                            and sustaining heavier traffic. The new site is also running on multiple
                            servers in multiple data centers for improved performance under load.
Open data, open source code: All of the content and code on this site is
                            available for anyone to download. The core data repositories
                            are available at HistoryAtState on GitHub. The web application is available at the hsg-shell repository. Follow our
                            progress, fork our code, file issues, and send us your pull requests. The hsg-project
                            repository contains all instructions to install a complete copy of the
                            site on your own computer.

Known Issues
In the coming weeks we will be addressing the following notable known issues. Please report any other problems you have noticed.

Country Issues articles and the photo gallery from the Southeast Asia conference have not been migrated.
                            (#150)

Follow our progress on these and other issues at our GitHub issue tracker.
Features Planned for Future Releases
Besides these features, we are laying the foundation for new resources on the history
                        of U.S. foreign relations and the Department of State:

A unified biographical database of all persons identified in datasets such as the
                            Foreign Relations series, Principal Officers and Chiefs of Mission, Travels
                            of the President and Secretary of State, and Visits of Foreign Leaders.
A database of historical country names, for connecting resources about places whose
                            names have changed over time.
Chronological sorting of search results from the Foreign Relations series.

Thank you for your interest in our website, and please return for updates.

Open Government Initiative
Transparency, participation, and collaboration are the foundation of open government. In
                        keeping with this principle established in the President’s December 2009 Open
                            Government Directive, the Office of the Historian has adapted its publications to
                        open digital formats that can be accessed and consumed easily by the public, including third
                        party developers. In 2010, the Office of the Historian made the following submissions to
                        data.gov, which remain up to date: 
Bibliographic Metadata of the Foreign Relations of
                                        the United States Series: Raw bibliographic metadata for the nearly
                                500 volumes in the Foreign Relations of the
                                        United States series published since 1861. Each record in the
                                dataset contains a volume’s title, year of publication, years covered by the volume,
                                summary, and links to sources for these volumes online or in print, among other

Building on this foundation and extending the focus beyond data, the President’s May 2012 Digital Government Strategy emphasized delivering better digital services to the
                        American people government through mobile devices and providing automated services for third
                        party web and app developers. In 2013, the Office of the Historian made the following
                        contributions to the Digital Government Strategy: 
Ebook Editions of Office of the Historian
                                Publications: The Foreign Relations of the United States
                                (FRUS) series, established in 1861, was adapted to ebook. Far lighter
                                and more portable than printed editions of FRUS, the ebook edition offers
                                the full content of each volume and makes use of the full-text search and other
                                reading features of most ebook devices and applications, including bookmarking and
                                note-taking. Unlike the web-based edition of FRUS, the ebook edition, once
                                downloaded, can be accessed even without internet connectivity. The ebooks were
                                generated from the master digital files at no additional cost and are available for
                                free download.
Office of the Historian Ebook Catalog API: This Application Programming Interface
                                (API) enables third party web and app developers, as well as users of these
                                applications, to embed the Office of the Historian ebook catalog. The API uses best
                                practices and open standards, including the
                                Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) format for ebook catalogs and REST interfaces.

Click here for a full list.
The Office of the Historian continues to expand its efforts to integrate teaching about
                        American diplomacy into all the social studies disciplines through teacher workshops and

The Office has also played a foundational role in the first Department of Education Teaching
                        American History grant ever awarded on U.S. foreign policy.

Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers,
                    1945, General: The United Nations, Volume I

Preface






Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers,
                    1945, General: The United Nations, Volume I








Preface
This volume was prepared under the direct supervision of the former Chief of the
                    Foreign Relations Division, E. Ralph Perkins, assisted by
                    the present head of the division, S. Everett Gleason, and
                    by Fredrick Aandahl. The compilers of the volume were
                        Velma Hastings Cassidy, Ralph R.
                        Goodwin, and a former member of the Division, George H.
                        Dengler.
The Publishing and Reproduction Services Division (Jerome H.
                        Perlmutter, Chief) was responsible for the technical editing of
                    the volume. This function was performed in the Historical Editing Section under
                    the direct supervision of Elizabeth A. Vary, Chief, and
                        Ouida J. Ward, Assistant Chief.

March 1, 1967


Principles for the Compilation and Editing of
                            “Foreign Relations”

The principles which guide the compilation and editing of Foreign Relations are stated in Department of State Regulation
                        1350 of June 15, 1961, a revision of the order approved on March 26, 1925,
                        by Mr. Frank B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The
                        text of the current regulation is printed below:
1350 Documentary Record of American
                            Diplomacy

1351 Scope of Documentation

The publication Foreign Relations of the United States,
                            Diplomatic Papers, constitutes the official record of the foreign
                        policy of the United States. These volumes include, subject to necessary
                        security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record
                        of the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of
                        State’s responsibilities, together with appropriate materials concerning the
                        facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. When further
                        material is needed to supplement the documentation in the Department’s files
                        for a proper understanding of the relevant policies of the United States,
                        such papers should be obtained from other Government agencies.[Page IV]
1352 Editorial Preparation

The basic documentary diplomatic record to be printed in Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic Papers, shall
                        be edited by the Historical Office, Bureau of Public Affairs of the
                        Department of State. The editing of the record shall be guided by the
                        principles of historical objectivity. There shall be no alteration of the
                        text, no deletions without indicating where in the text the deletion is
                        made, and no omission of facts which were of major importance in reaching a
                        decision. Nothing shall be omitted for the purpose of concealing or glossing
                        over what might be regarded by some as a defect of policy. However, certain
                        omissions of documents are permissible for the following reasons: 
a.

To avoid publication of matters which would tend to impede current
                                diplomatic negotiations or other business.
b.

To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless
                                details.
c.

To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by
                                individuals and by foreign governments.
d.

To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or
                                individuals.
e.

To eliminate personal opinions presented in despatches and not
                                acted upon by the Department. To this consideration there is one
                                qualification—in connection with major decisions it is desirable,
                                where possible, to show the alternatives presented to the Department
                                before the decision was made.

1353 Clearance

To obtain appropriate clearances of material to be published in Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic
                            Papers, the Historical Office shall: 
a.

Refer to the appropriate policy offices of the Department and of
                                other agencies of the Government such papers as appear to require
                                policy clearance.
b.

Refer to the appropriate foreign governments requests for
                                permission to print as part of the diplomatic correspondence of the
                                United States those previously unpublished documents which were
                                originated by the foreign governments.

AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY: SELECTED PUBLIC DOCUMENTS
Beginning with the year 1950, American Foreign Policy, a
                    companion series to Foreign Relations of the United
                        States, provides systematic coverage of the principal messages,
                    addresses, statements, reports, and of certain of the diplomatic notes exchanged
                    and treaties made in a given period that indicate the scope, goals, and
                    implementation of the foreign policy of the United States. For the immediately
                    preceding years, 1945–1949 inclusive, the present series, Foreign Relations, will provide under this heading a brief indication
                    of certain major documents in these categories. This listing does not purport to
                    be complete, of course, and as a rule items dealing primarily with United States
                    relations with particular countries will be noted in the compilations for those
                    countries. Many of the items cited below are also referred to in appropriate

                    present-day foreign relations makes it essential for the United States to
                    maintain informational activities abroad as an integral part of the conduct of
                    our foreign affairs” (Bulletin, September 2, 1945, pp.

                    effective October 1, abolished the O.S.S. and transferred its remaining
                    activities to the War Department. The President added that the transfer [Page XI]would provide the Secretary of State
                    “with the resources which we have agreed you will need to aid in the development
                    of our foreign policy, and will assure that pertinent experience accumulated
                    during the war will be preserved and used in meeting the problems of the peace.”
                    The President further stated that he particularly desired the Secretary of State
                    “to take the lead in developing a comprehensive and coordinated foreign
                    intelligence program for all Federal agencies concerned with that type of
                    activity … through the creation of an interdepartmental group, heading up under
                    the State Department, which would formulate plans for my approval.” For texts of

Overview
In keeping with the goal of the President’s Digital Government Strategy to deliver better digital services to the
                            American people, the Office of the Historian has created its first public Application Programming Interface
                            (API) and has established this page to house information for developers. We invite
                            developers to use our API and provide feedback.


Ebook Catalog API
The Office of the Historian Ebook Catalog API is a
                            RESTful, OPDS-formatted catalog of the growing number of free ebooks from the
                                Foreign Relations of the United States series. Use this API to embed
                            our live, up-to-date, searchable, and browsable ebook catalog in your application
                            and to locate download links to the ebooks and their cover images.


Support
Developers are welcome to visit our organizational account on GitHub. Requests or inquiries may
                            be submitted as issues.


Technologies &amp; Standards
This website is powered by eXist-db, a free, open
                            source XML server and the open standard W3C technologies it supports, including
                            XQuery 3.0, EXPath, and EXQuery.
Our digitization initiatives center around the Text
                                Encoding Initiative (TEI), an open, mature, XML-based standard used widely
                            in libraries and the humanities. All our article- and book-length content is encoded
                            as TEI. A single digital master TEI file can store an entire FRUS volume.
                            We store this TEI in eXist-db and convert it to TEI into HTML or ebook forms using
                            XQuery.
Our ebook catalog API uses the Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS), an Atom
                            XML-based standard for encoding ebook catalogs.

Conferences
The Office of the Historian periodically hosts or co-hosts scholarly conferences on specific
                        topics of interest related to the history of U.S. foreign relations. These conferences
                        typically aim to bring together former diplomats and policymakers with respected scholars of
                        U.S. foreign relations. The Office of the Historian has also been successful in including
                        current policymakers in these conferences. These conferences are generally open to the
                        public, although pre-registration might be required.
