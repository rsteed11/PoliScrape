* uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/FRUS/ *
	- From series inception, 1861-1960
	- Search parameters: strings, compound strings, proximity searches (second or third term within x words of first); perhaps the only repository with these features?	

- Not geared around FOIA; based on making more library material accessible on internet
- * for truncation
- Searches types of works (like OH filter)
- Boolean search (AND, OR, NOT) with nesting (only once though)
- Change number of results
- Can do proximity with Booleans (in same sentence or paragraph)
- Proximity is within x number of words
- Can do "near," "followed by," or opposite of both

TODO:

//- Find book IBN//
//- Look into, take notes on web crawling - try to start something?//
//- Visit Undergrad Library to look into textbook//

LEARNED: 
- Google works so fast because it saves search results on server (not possible for us)
- Jumping from site to site is relatively easy, but figuring out how to extract information from FRUS files is tougher
- How to parse results so understandable?
