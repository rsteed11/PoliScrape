In\n                        keeping with this principle established in the President\u2019s December 2009 Open\n                            Government Directive, the Office of the Historian has adapted its publications to\n                        open digital formats that can be accessed and consumed easily by the public, including third\n                        party developers. In 2010, the Office of the Historian made the following submissions to\n                        data.gov, which remain up to date: \nBibliographic Metadata of the Foreign Relations of\n                                        the United States Series: Raw bibliographic metadata for the nearly\n                                500 volumes in the Foreign Relations of the\n                                        United States series published since 1861. Each record in the\n                                dataset contains a volume\u2019s title, year of publication, years covered by the volume,\n                                summary, and links to sources for these volumes online or in print, among other\n                                metadata items.

The feed is updated as soon as\n                                a new volume is published.

In 2013, the Office of the Historian made the following\n                        contributions to the Digital Government Strategy: \nEbook Editions of Office of the Historian\n                                Publications: The Foreign Relations of the United States\n                                (FRUS) series, established in 1861, was adapted to ebook. Far lighter\n                                and more portable than printed editions of FRUS, the ebook edition offers\n                                the full content of each volume and makes use of the full-text search and other\n                                reading features of most ebook devices and applications, including bookmarking and\n                                note-taking. Unlike the web-based edition of FRUS, the ebook edition, once\n                                downloaded, can be accessed even without internet connectivity. The ebooks were\n                                generated from the master digital files at no additional cost and are available for\n                                free download.\nOffice of the Historian Ebook Catalog API: This Application Programming Interface\n                                (API) enables third party web and app developers, as well as users of these\n                                applications, to embed the Office of the Historian ebook catalog.

The Office\u2019s historians work closely with other federal government\n                            history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the\n                            globe. The Office is directed by Dr. Stephen\n                                Randolph, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.\n\n\nWhat We Do\nThe Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and\n                            publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the\n                            Foreign Relations of the United States series.\nIn addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for\n                            Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential\n                            background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify\n                            precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on\n                            institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make\n                            decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their\n                            choices. The Office of the Historian conducts an array of initiatives, ranging\n                            from briefing memos to multi-year research projects.\nThe Office of the Historian also promotes the declassification of documents to\n                            ensure a complete and accurate understanding of the past.\n\n\nForeign Relations of the United States\n\nThe Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series presents the official\n                            documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions. The series\n                            began in 1861 and now comprises more than 480 individual volumes.\nForeign Relations volumes contain documents from the Presidential libraries,\n                            Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central\n                            Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign\n                            affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in\n                            implementing U.S. foreign policy.\nLearn more about the series and view the collection at our Historical Documents page.\n\n\nOur Outreach Activities\nThe Office\u2019s public outreach activities include hosting scholarly conferences on\n                            key issues in the history of U.S. foreign policy, answering historical research\n                            questions, consulting with scholars, educators, and students, and working with\n                            high school teachers across the country to provide high-quality materials for\n                            classroom use.\n\n\nHow to Access Our Materials\nThe Office maintains a public website at history.state.gov,\n                            which provides in-depth information to the public on the history of U.S. foreign\n                            policy. In addition to a full text archive of\n                                the Foreign Relations series, the website includes valuable\n                            encyclopedic content on the history of U.S. relations\n                                with states around the world, a database of the Department\u2019s principal officers and\n                                chiefs of mission, and special tools and\n                                resources for students and teachers.\nIn keeping with the Open Government Directive\u2019s principle of transparency,\n                            participation, and collaboration as the cornerstone of an open government, the\n                            Office of the Historian has begun preparing many of its rich historical\n                            publications in a raw data format that can be accessed through data.gov.

This current list is based on\n                        information received from American diplomatic posts abroad, as well as web\n                        sources and communication with the archives themselves. The information provided\n                        here is subject to change so researchers are advised to contact the government\n                        or archive ahead of any planned visit. \nSelect an article from the list of all countries.\nWhile access to the diplomatic records of many countries remains highly\n                        restricted, the news is better than ever before with many new countries\n                        establishing Freedom of Information Acts to foment better government\n                        transparency. \nThe divide between the developed world and the developing world also affects the\n                        state of international archives. Problems of infrastructure inhibit the nature\n                        of information dissemination. The amount of information available on the\n                        internet varies from country to country and many National Archives and\n                        Ministries of Foreign Affairs are still in the process of developing workable\n                        websites.\nThis site does not comment on the state of the records themselves. In addition to\n                        the loss of records as a result of changes of government and civil war, the\n                        climate has wreaked havoc upon some archives, particularly in tropical regions,\n                        whose documents, despite the best efforts of archivists, have been compromised\n                        by heat, humidity, flooding, and frequent power outages.\nIn compiling this database, the Office of the Historian has tried to give\n                        researchers a starting place for their inquiries. We have not included anecdotal\n                        advice on how to approach any given archive. Countries that do not\n                        systematically declassify their documents may require personal contacts to gain\n                        access to records of interest. Additionally, compliance with laws that guide\n                        freedom of information may vary.\nFor the most part, diplomatic records are held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n                        (or a similar department) or have been transferred to a National Archive. If\n                        that is done systematically, it is usually apparent as to which records are\n                        available for viewing. When transfer is not systematic, it is up to the\n                        researcher to discover the location of the documents they wish to view as well\n                        as to make contact with the relevant archivist.\nThe Office of the Historian would be happy to receive updated or missing\n                        information.

Your style guide may require\n                    different formatting of a citation, so you may need to adapt the elements of the sample\n                    citations below to a specific format.\nCite document numbers rather than page numbers\nEvery document in the Foreign Relations series since the 1955\u201357 subseries has been\n                    assigned a sequential number unique within the volume. The advantage of citing a Foreign\n                        Relations document by its document number is that, unlike page numbers, the numbers\n                    are media neutral and remain consistent across different media: print, web, and ebook. An\n                    example of a citation to document number is as follows:\nForeign Relations\n                        of the United States, 1969\u20131976, Volume XIX, Part 1, Korea, 1969\u20131972, eds. Daniel\n                    J. Lawler and Erin R. Mahan (Washington: Government Printing Office, 2010), Document\n                    75.\nThe components of this citation are as follows:\n\nSeries title: Foreign Relations of the United States\n\nSubseries title: 1969\u20131976\nVolume number: Volume XIX, Part 1\nVolume title: Korea, 1969\u20131972\nEditors (not to include the General Editor): Daniel J. Lawler and Erin R. Mahan\nCity: Washington, D.C.\nPublisher: Government Printing Office\nYear published: 2010\nLocation within the volume: Document 75\n\nCite volumes by URL\nParticularly if you consulted the web or ebook edition of a Foreign Relations\n                    volume, we recommend appending the canonic URL for the volume (or document) to your\n                    reference. This will allow readers to directly access the source. Taking the previous\n                    citation as an example, the following URL would be appended to the end of the citation,\n                    often including a date the material was accessed:\nhttp://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v19p1/d75 [accessed 27 Oct\n                    2011]\nURLs to Foreign Relations documents always follow this structure: the Office of the\n                    Historian\u2019s website domain (\u201chttp://history.state.gov\u201d), section (\u201chistoricaldocuments\u201d),\n                    volume identifier (\u201cfrus1969-76v19p1\u201d), and document identifier (\u201cd75\u201d).\nA scanned image of the original printed page (or scanned document, in the case of certain electronic-only\n                    volumes) is available for citation by URL. You can find these URLs in the right sidebar of\n                    each document, labeled \"View Image.\" For example, the sidebar for document 75 contains links to\n                    the images of pages 190, 191, and 192. Notice that in these\n                    page-number-based URLs, the document identifier (\u201cd75\u201d) is substituted with the page number\n                    identifier (\u201cpg_190\u201d, etc.).\nCitations to ebook editions are no different for these examples.\nWhen citing a document number is not possible\nSince volumes before the 1955\u201357 subseries did not include document numbers, citations must\n                    reference page numbers:\nForeign Relations\n                        of the United States, 1952\u20131954, General: Economic and Political Matters, Volume I,\n                    Part 1, eds. David M. Baehler, Herbert A. Fine, Ralph R. Goodwin, N. Stephen Kane, Ronald D.\n                    Landa, Lisle A. Rose, William F. Sanford, Jr., and Ilana M. Stern (Washington: Government\n                    Printing Office, 1983), 798\u2013800.\nDocument numbers have been superimposed on the web and ebook edition of all these earlier\n                    volumes that have been digitized, so that every document has a unique URL. But take caution\n                    that readers of the print edition will not be able to locate a citation in these volumes by\n                    document number (e.g., the web edition of the above citation appears as \u201cDocument 221\u201d). \nVariations in the titles of early Foreign Relations volumes\nEarly editions of the Foreign Relations series used a variety of titles. For\n                    example:\nPapers Relating\n                        to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1918, Russia, Volume III\n                    (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1932), 51.\nPapers Relating\n                        to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1893 (Washington: Government\n                    Printing Office, 1894), 452\u2013453.\nMessage of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the\n                        Commencement of the Third Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress (Washington:\n                    Government Printing Office, 1862), 356\u2013370.\n(For more information on the titles, see the discussion of the term \u201cForeign\n                        Relations series\u201d in the history of the Foreign Relations series.)\nAlso, earlier volumes typically do not identify the editors, in which case the names of\n                    editors can not be included in a citation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Documents\n\n\nBrowse official documents from the published Foreign Relations of the United States series.\n\n\nBrowse by Administration\n\n\nPre-Truman Volumes\n\nTruman Administration\n\nEisenhower Administration\n\nKennedy Administration\n\nJohnson Administration\n\nNixon Administration\n\nFord Administration\n\nCarter Administration\n\nReagan Administration\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Resources\n\n\nMore about\n                            the Foreign Relations series\n\nStatus of the Series\n\nHistory of the Series\n\nForeign Relations Ebooks\n\nOther Electronic Resources for\n                            U.S. Foreign Relations\n\nGuide to Sources on\n                            Vietnam, 1969-1975\n\nTips for searching the Foreign Relations Series\n\nHow to cite Foreign Relations documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

To locate documents which include both \u201cpeaceful\u201d and \u201cnuclear\u201d anywhere in the\n                        text, use the following search:\npeaceful nuclear\n\nTo locate documents which use the phrase \u201cpeaceful nuclear,\u201d use this search:\n\"peaceful nuclear\"\n\n\n\nBooleans\nThe search engine will allow you to perform Boolean searches (AND, OR, and NOT). Boolean\n                        operators must be in all caps.\nYou can use Boolean operators with individual terms or with phrases enclosed in quotation\n                        marks. For example, to locate documents which include both the word \u201cKissinger\u201d and the\n                        phrase \u201cpeaceful nuclear,\u201d use this search:\nKissinger AND\n                            \"peaceful nuclear\"\n\nTo locate documents which include either \u201cRhodesia\u201d or \u201cZimbabwe,\u201d use this search:\nRhodesia OR Zimbabwe\n\nTo locate documents which include the phrase \u201carms control\u201d but exclude documents which\n                        also include the term \u201cSALT,\u201d use this search:\n\"arms control\" NOT SALT\n\nYou can also use the plus (+) and minus (-) signs to include or exclude certain terms. To\n                        search for documents which must include the phrase \u201claw of the sea\u201d and may include the\n                        term \u201cseabed,\u201d use this search:\n+\"law of the sea\" seabed\n\nTo search for documents which include \u201cKorea\u201d but not \u201cDMZ,\u201d use this search:\nKorea -DMZ\n\nFinally, you can use parentheses to nest your searches. To find documents which include\n                        \u201cGuatemala\u201d or \u201cEl Salvador\u201d and \u201cBelize,\u201d use this search:\n(Guatemala OR\n                            \"El Salvador\") AND Belize\n\n\n\nWildcards\nIf you are unsure about the spelling of a term or want to find variants of a term, you\n                        can use wildcards. The search engine supports two wildcard characters: ? and *.\nIf you want to replace a single letter in your search term, use ? in your query. To find\n                        documents which include \u201ctext\u201d or \u201ctest,\u201d use this search:\nte?t\n\nNote that the above search will not return hits for \u201cTet\u201d or \u201cteapot.\u201d If you want to\n                        replace zero or more letters in your search term use * in your query. For example, to\n                        find documents which include \u201cVietnam\u201d and \u201cVietnamese,\u201d use this search:\nVietna*\n\nNote that the above search will not return hits for \u201cViet Nam,\u201d another spelling of the\n                        same country. You may have to try multiple variants of the same search to get all the\n                        results you need.\n\n\nProximity\nIf you are searching for common words, you can tell the search engine to only return\n                        documents in which the words are within a distance you define. To find documents which\n                        include \u201cCuba\u201d and \u201csubmarine\u201d within 10 words of each other, use this search:\n\"Cuba submarine\"~10\n\nWe are aware that \u201ckeyword in context\u201d summary of the results of proximity searches are\n                        not displaying correctly. The search results themselves, however, are reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Keefer, John M. Carland, and Bradley L. Coleman\n                        Office of the Historian, U.S. Department of State\n                        Released February 1, 2012\nThe Vietnam war is one of the best documented events in U.S. history.\u00a0\n                        Federal agencies generated a large and unique variety of archival material\n                        during the conflict, from traditional memoranda and telegrams, to\n                        backchannel messages and White House tape recordings.\u00a0 This guide to\n                        archival resources, based on the work of the Office of the Historian, U.S.\n                        Department of State, describes the sources used to compile the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) documentary\n                        series on the Vietnam war during the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford\n                        Administrations, from January 1969 to May 1975.\u00a0 Despite the expansive\n                        coverage dedicated to the Vietnam war in the Foreign\n                        Relations series, space constraints forced Department of State\n                        historians to choose carefully among the thousands of documents produced\n                        during the conflict.\u00a0 This guide aims to provide a road map for researchers\n                        seeking to go beyond documents included in Foreign\n                        Relations to archival resources housed both in Washington and in\n                        various locations around the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn compiling the Foreign Relations series, Department\n                        of State historians had a very specific mission to capture: the documentary\n                        record of high-level policy decisions and civilian direction and management\n                        of the war; U.S. political and military strategy; peace negotiations with\n                        the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the National\n                        Liberation Front (NLF); U.S. support for the armed forces of the Republic of\n                        Vietnam (South Vietnam); and diplomatic, political, and economic relations\n                        with South Vietnam.\u00a0 The five Foreign Relations\n                        volumes covering the Nixon and Ford administrations contain notes on\n                        sources, annotated source lists, and copious footnotes.\u00a0 Readers should use\n                        this guide in conjunction with the published volumes.\u00a0 Before undertaking\n                        archival research, researches should study carefully the documentation\n                        contained in the Foreign Relations volumes on Vietnam\n                        from 1969 to 1975.\u00a0 Researchers can purchase the volumes through the U.S.\n                        Government Printing Office or view them free of charge on the Office of the\n                        Historian, U.S. Department of State website (http://history.state.gov).\u00a0 In\n                        keeping with prevailing scholarly practices, documents researchers initially\n                        encounter in the series should be cited to Foreign\n                        Relations.\nDuring the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, the President directed that the\n                        U.S. military limit operations to South Vietnam, with the exception of the\n                        U.S. air campaign against the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the intermittent bombing\n                        of the North during Rolling Thunder.\u00a0 Department of State historians\n                        covering this period determined it desirable to segregate the conflicts in\n                        Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into separate Foreign\n                        Relations volumes.\u00a0 When Richard Nixon entered office in January 1969,\n                        however, the President and Special Assistant for National Security Henry\n                        Kissinger expanded the war beyond South Vietnam into enemy sanctuaries in\n                        Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam.\u00a0 For this reason, Foreign Relations volumes covering Vietnam during this phase of the\n                        war document events across Southeast Asia, including activities such as the\n                        invasions of Cambodia (1970) and Laos (1971); the widespread bombing of\n                        North Vietnam (1972); and the SS Mayaguez incident\n                        (1975).\nAfter a careful reading of the Foreign Relations\n                        volumes, researchers should consult the extensive Presidential papers and\n                        other White House records at the Nixon Presidential Materials Project.\u00a0 In\n                        2010 the Nixon records were transferred from the National Archives in\n                        College Park, Maryland to the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda,\n                        California.\u00a0 Within this collection, the most valuable information bearing\n                        on the administration\u2019s management of the Vietnam War and its search for a\n                        negotiated peace in Southeast Asia are the National Security Council (NSC)\n                        Files.\nTwo sub-files within the NSC materials provide the best documentation: the\n                        Vietnam Subject Files and the Country Files for Vietnam.\u00a0 These files hold\n                        the working records of the NSC staff members responsible for analyzing\n                        information on Vietnam for Kissinger, who in turn would use their analyses\n                        in his communications with President Nixon.\u00a0 The Vietnam Subject Files is a\n                        topical collection that deals not only with Vietnam but also with Laos,\n                        Cambodia, Thailand, and Southeast Asia as a whole.\u00a0 For example, material on\n                        the 1971 U.S.-supported South Vietnamese cross-border operation, Lam Son\n                        719, is in the Vietnam Subject Files under the sub-file Special Operations\n                        File.\u00a0 Although the Vietnam Subject Files collection is weighed towards\n                        military issues, it also contains abundant records on the attempt to manage\n                        the peace process in Vietnam after January 1973.\u00a0 Like other Nixon records,\n                        the archivists have prepared finding aids with folder titles.\u00a0 The Vietnam\n                        Country Files collection, consisting of 29 Hollinger boxes, holds diplomatic\n                        and political material primarily about Vietnam and U.S. relations with the\n                        Republic of Vietnam.\u00a0 The boxes, folders, and items within are organized\n                        chronologically.\u00a0 In some cases there are sub-chronologies in each folder of\n                        Department of State cables, intelligence cables, and memoranda.\u00a0 The Vietnam\n                        Country Files is the single most cited collection in the five Foreign Relations volumes on Vietnam from 1969 to\n                        1975.\nThe Far East Country Files, 31 Hollinger boxes, contain folders on Cambodia,\n                        Laos, Southeast Asia, Indochina, and Thailand.\u00a0 Although similar in\n                        organization to the Vietnam Country Files, it lacks specific subject\n                        folders, but does include topical and issue-specific folders.\u00a0 Additionally,\n                        there is a Cambodian Operations File, consisting of 21 Hollinger boxes, that\n                        contains a combination of chronological and topical records covering the\n                        U.S.-South Vietnamese movement into Cambodia from April to July 1970.\u00a0 The\n                        files consist mostly of daily situation and action reports, including many\n                        to the President, as well as longer reports and briefings to Congress and\n                        others on the Cambodian operation.\u00a0 The Nodis/Khmer section of this file\n                        focuses on efforts by various nations to support the Cambodian effort.\nThe search for a negotiated peace is a principal theme of the Foreign Relations coverage of the Vietnam war.\u00a0 Official\n                        peace negotiations were held in Paris at the International Conference Center\n                        on Avenue Kl\u00e9ber.\u00a0 Documentation on these talks, consisting of some 28\n                        Hollinger boxes, is located in the Paris/Talks Meeting Files.\u00a0 This file\n                        begins during the Johnson administration and contains the records\u2014mostly\n                        cables to and from the delegation in Paris\u2014of the W. Averell Harriman and\n                        Cyrus Vance Mission (HARVAN), from May 1968 to January 1969.\u00a0 During the\n                        Nixon administration, the file covers cable traffic between the Department\n                        of State and the delegation in Paris, and to and from the Embassy in\n                        Saigon.\u00a0 There are a few topical folders in the collection with\n                        non-telegraphic material, but it is essentially a cables file with the bulk\n                        of the material dated between 1969 and 1970.\nThe Nixon administration preferred to use private talks in Paris, as opposed\n                        to the official public sessions at Avenue Kl\u00e9ber, as the primary venue for\n                        serious negotiations. In August 1969, Washington and Hanoi opened a secret\n                        negotiations channel.\u00a0 At these discussions, Kissinger represented the\n                        United States and Hanoi\u2019s Chief Delegate at Paris Xuan Thuy, later joined by\n                        Special Adviser Le Duc Tho, represented North Vietnam.\u00a0 Le Duc Tho was a\n                        member of the Politburo in Hanoi and the real chief of the delegation.\u00a0 The\n                        records of the Kissinger and Xuan Thuy-Le Duc Tho negotiations were\n                        maintained by NSC staff member Winston Lord, the principal note taker for\n                        these secret meetings, and are located in the NSC Files, For the\n                        President\u2019s\u2014China/Vietnam Negotiations, C.D. [Camp David].\u00a0 This file\n                        includes virtually all verbatim memoranda of the secret talks, as well as\n                        summary memoranda prepared by Kissinger and his staff for the President.\u00a0\n                        This collection also reveals how Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and South\n                        Vietnamese President Thieu kept abreast of the negotiations.\u00a0 In all, the\n                        Vietnam negotiations portion of the file maintained by Winston Lord fills 24\n                        Hollinger boxes.\u00a0 A second file by the same name exists in the NSC Files,\n                        and consists of 3 Hollinger boxes containing mostly copies of Kissinger\u2019s\n                        secret talks with Le Duc Tho, original letters from Thieu to Nixon from late\n                        1972 to early 1973, and memoranda of conversations for Kissinger\u2019s trip to\n                        South Vietnam in October 1972 and Haig\u2019s trip in November 1972.\nAs for U.S.-Soviet relations, the Nixon administration wanted Moscow to\n                        pressure North Vietnam into a political settlement.\u00a0 To this end, Nixon and\n                        Kissinger engaged in private talks with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Fedorovich\n                        Dobrynin.\u00a0 Nine Hollinger boxes of records related to those meeting are in\n                        the NSC Files, President\u2019s Trip File, Dobrynin/Kissinger.\nFollowing the aforementioned collections, next in importance are several\n                        other collections within the NSC Files.\u00a0 The first is the Backchannel Files\n                        which contain secret communications between the White House (essentially the\n                        President or Kissinger) and U.S. ambassadors, conducted without the\n                        knowledge of the official Department of State bureaucracy. Although the\n                        collection includes all backchannel messages, a good portion relate to\n                        backchannel messages between the White House and Ambassadors Bunker and\n                        Graham A. Martin in Saigon, and to and from other ambassadors in Southeast\n                        Asia.\u00a0 For 1969, however, backchannel communications between the White House\n                        and Ambassador Bunker are filed in the Vietnam Subject File.\u00a0 On almost all\n                        occasions, these backchannel messages were more important to the policy\n                        process than the regular Department of State telegrams.\u00a0 Backchannel\n                        messages to and from U.S. negotiators in Paris are also in this\n                        collection.\nThe Kissinger Office Files\u2014the records of the Special Assistant to the\n                        President for National Security Affairs maintained by his immediate\n                        staff\u2014are also in the NSC Files.\u00a0 A key source for documents on U.S. policy\n                        toward Vietnam, this collection contains Kissinger\u2019s trip files, items such\n                        as briefing books, memoranda, and memoranda of conversations relating to his\n                        travels.\u00a0 These records cover his visit to Saigon in October 1972 to confer\n                        with President Nguyen Van Thieu; his negotiating sessions in Paris with Le\n                        Duc Tho; his February 1973 Hanoi visit; and activities related to the June\n                        1973 Joint Communiqu\u00e9.\u00a0 The Kissinger Office Files also have separate\n                        Country Files, Far East, sub-section that contains records on Cambodia,\n                        especially relating to the efforts of Colonel Jonathan \u201cFred\u201d Ladd, sent to\n                        Phnom Penh by the President, to bolster the fighting ability of Lon Nol\u2019s\n                        armed forces.\u00a0 A Vietnam-South Vietnam Country File, which covers 1971\u20131972\n                        and contains a sub-section on Vietnam-Vietnam Negotiations, are also in the\n                        Office Files but, it should be emphasized, the most important material on\n                        this issue is in the For the President\u2019s Files.\nValuable documents relating to Vietnam are in other collections in the NSC\n                        Files.\u00a0 The Haig Chronological Files includes memoranda, correspondence, and\n                        message traffic to and from Haig, much of it relating to Vietnam.\u00a0 It also\n                        contains one box of transcripts of a number of telephone conversations among\n                        Haig, Nixon, Kissinger, and other NSC staff members.\u00a0 These transcripts do\n                        not seem to appear elsewhere and often contain significant policy\n                        discussions.\u00a0 The Haig Special File has material arranged topically, much of\n                        which relates to Haig\u2019s trips to South Vietnam (aimed at informing President\n                        Thieu about the state of the negotiations and, more importantly, at\n                        persuading him to accept the American proposals and approach).\u00a0 This file\n                        also includes documents on Haig\u2019s trips to other Southeast Asian nations.\u00a0\n                        The Agency File, Department of Defense, contains considerable documentation\n                        on Vietnam, while the Subject Files (as opposed to the Vietnam Subject\n                        Files) hold only occasional Vietnam-related items, some of which is useful,\n                        such as Items to Discuss with the President.\u00a0 A chronological collection of\n                        documents within the NSC Files, the President\u2019s Daily Briefing Files often\n                        include reports on Vietnam with handwritten comments by President Nixon.\u00a0\n                        Finally, the Unfiled Material contains documentation on Vietnam.\u00a0 Made up of\n                        material not filed after the President resigned, the collection has no\n                        finding aid or organizational logic except that it is organized by\n                        date\u2014earliest to latest.\u00a0 There is no easy way to review it except document\n                        by document.\nThe NSC Files in the Nixon Presidential Materials also contain the National\n                        Security Council Institutional Files (H-Files), which should not to be\n                        confused with the NSC Institutional Matters File (a sub-file of the NSC\n                        Files comprising 19 boxes).\u00a0 The H-Files, consisting of 315 boxes, until\n                        recently were under the control of the NSC but have now been transferred to\n                        the Nixon Presidential Library.\u00a0 These files contain the minutes of National\n                        Security Council Meetings and NSC subgroups such as the Review Group/Senior\n                        Review Group and the Washington Special Actions Group (WSAG), chaired by\n                        Kissinger and attended by deputy heads of the federal agencies and the\n                        Director of Central Intelligence.\u00a0 Furthermore, for each set of minutes\n                        there are corresponding folders containing papers Kissinger used to prepare\n                        for the meetings.\u00a0 For Vietnam and Southeast Asia, the WSAG functioned as\n                        the key policy and crisis management entity.\u00a0 It dealt, sometimes on a daily\n                        basis during critical periods, with events in Vietnam and Southeast Asia,\n                        making policy decisions, or asking the President to make the decisions, and\n                        following up on Presidential directives.\u00a0 In addition, this file hold\n                        records of the Vietnam Special Study Group (VSSG), a White House dominated\n                        organization established to provide the President and Kissinger with\n                        independent analysis and advice. Also of value in the Institutional\n                        (H-Files) are the National Security Study Memoranda/National Security\n                        Decision Memoranda (NSSM/NSDM) Files, containing requests for studies, the\n                        studies themselves, and resulting decision memoranda.\nWhile the NSC Files and the NSC Institutional Files are the premier\n                        collections for Vietnam and Southeast Asia, additional useful collections\n                        exist in the Nixon Presidential Materials.\u00a0 For example, in the White House\n                        Special Files one finds the H. R. Haldeman Files, which holds Haldeman\u2019s\n                        handwritten accounts of his daily activities.\u00a0 During his time at the White\n                        House, Haldeman at first wrote and later dictated a daily diary.\u00a0 Although\n                        not a foreign policy expert, he was a close confidant of the President and,\n                        as Chief of Staff, very close to, and observant of, the decision making\n                        process.\u00a0 His diary is a treasure trove of great historical significance.\n                        Available on compact disk (The Haldeman Diaries, the\n                        Multi-Media Edition), a selection of key entries have been published in\n                        book form by G. Putnam and Sons as The Haldeman Diaries:\n                        Inside the Nixon White House.\u00a0 Additionally, the Nixon Presidential\n                        Diary, an appointments diary indicating where the President was and with\n                        whom he met or spoke on a given day, is an essential tool for researchers\n                        and is found in the White House Central Files, Staff Member and Office\n                        Files.\nThe archival sources at the Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan,\n                        offer the best coverage of the final months of the Vietnam war, including\n                        domestic political activities, the evacuation of Phnom Penh and Saigon, and\n                        the SS Mayaguez affair.\u00a0 The Presidential Country\n                        Files for East Asia and the Pacific contain invaluable documents, including\n                        memoranda, correspondence, telegrams, and reports.\u00a0 Organized by country\n                        name, there are 10 Hollinger boxes with materials exclusively related to\n                        U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia.\u00a0 The NSC East Asia and Pacific Affairs\n                        Staff Files offer additional documentation, including a chronological file,\n                        SS Mayaguez papers, and items generated for WSAG and\n                        NSC meetings.\u00a0 Valuable backchannel communications with Ambassador Martin\n                        and other Southeast Asian ambassadors fill 2 Hollinger boxes.\u00a0 Additionally,\n                        the library houses Ford administration H-Files, which include briefing\n                        books, memoranda, and WSAG meetings minutes produced during the U.S.\n                        evacuation of Cambodia and South Vietnam.\u00a0 A small collection of National\n                        Security Agency material at the Ford Library includes the text of helicopter\n                        radio communications during the April 1975 emergency.\u00a0 Researchers should\n                        also consult the Agency Files, NSC Vietnam Information Group Files, NSC\n                        Congressional Relations Files, NSC Meeting files, Kissinger and Scowcroft\n                        West Wing Files, Brent Scowcroft Daily Work Files, White House Central\n                        Files, Legislative Inter-Departmental Working Group Files, and Wolfgang\n                        Lehmann Papers.\u00a0 The library maintains detailed findings aids (available\n                        online) for each collection.\u00a0 There are also 10 Hollinger boxes of documents\n                        removed from the Embassy by Ambassador Martin during the evacuation, a\n                        unique collection considering the embassy staff destroyed or scattered most\n                        records covering the period from 1974 to 1975 during the final days in\n                        Saigon.\u00a0 Combined with the Martin backchannel messages, these records offer\n                        a detailed account of the Embassy\u2019s experience, important considering the\n                        Ambassador\u2019s great personal influence on the handling of the evacuation.\nThe Henry Kissinger Papers at the Library of Congress are likewise valuable.\u00a0\n                        Although the collection is not open to the public, Kissinger permitted\n                        Department of State historians access to these records for use in the Foreign Relations series.\u00a0 Material in the papers often\n                        replicate documents found in other collections; it nonetheless holds some\n                        unique material.\u00a0 Foremost in this category are the transcripts of Kissinger\n                        telephone conversations based on notes taken by a secretary listening in on\n                        the phone at Kissinger\u2019s office at the White House or transcribed from tapes\n                        recordings from his home telephone.\u00a0 Needless to say, the Kissinger\n                        telephone conversations are a key source for Vietnam War policy.\u00a0 While\n                        general researchers cannot use the transcripts at the Library of Congress,\n                        Kissinger has allowed copies to be transferred to the National Archives,\n                        where most are open to the public.\nOther than the transcripts of telephone conversations, Kissinger\u2019s speeches\n                        and writings, and his Record of Schedule (appointment diary), the Kissinger\n                        Papers are segregated into a classified file (secret and below), a\n                        top-secret file, and a section containing a limited amount of restricted\n                        data and special compartmentalized information.\u00a0 In this material, the best\n                        collection for Vietnam and Southeast Asia is the Geopolitical File, which\n                        contains a wide-ranging section on Vietnam and smaller files on Cambodia and\n                        Laos.\u00a0 Also of value within the Kissinger Papers are the Memoranda to the\n                        President File, the Memoranda of Conversations File, and the Presidential\n                        File.\u00a0 However, none of these deal exclusively with Vietnam and Southeast\n                        Asia.\nThe Department of State, Department of Defense, and to a lesser extent the\n                        Central Intelligence Agency, although strong bureaucratic players in the\n                        Johnson Administration\u2019s policymaking, played a reduced role under President\n                        Nixon and Henry Kissinger, who concentrated policymaking in the White\n                        House.\u00a0 The files of the Department of State, especially the Central Files\n                        and certain Lot Files, are valuable for tracking events in Vietnam, Laos,\n                        and Cambodia, and at the Paris Talks.\u00a0 Before Kissinger became Secretary of\n                        State in September 1973, Department of State records offer poor coverage of\n                        U.S. policy toward Southeast Asia, because Nixon and Kissinger intentionally\n                        excluded the Secretary of State and the Department from the Vietnam\n                        decision-making process.\u00a0 Still, some of the Central Files are useful for\n                        political, economic, and military developments in Southeast Asia from 1969\n                        to 1974, including POL 27 CAMB/KHMER, POL 27 LAOS, and POL 27 VIET S.\u00a0 While\n                        ostensibly the designation for military operations in Vietnam, and to a\n                        lesser extent Laos and Cambodia, POL 27 became a catchall file.\u00a0\n                        Consequently, it is a good source of material for those interested in\n                        political developments in Saigon, Vientiane, or Phnom Penh.\u00a0 In the Lot\n                        Files one finds Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker\u2019s weekly and later monthly\n                        summaries of events in South Vietnam to President Nixon.\u00a0 They covered in\n                        detail the government, politics, the economy, and the war.\u00a0 Although the\n                        President rarely read the reports, they nonetheless provide a useful account\n                        of important events in South Vietnam; they have been collected and published\n                        as The Bunker Papers, Reports to\n                        the President from Vietnam, 1967\u20131973 (Berkeley, 1990).\u00a0 The Central\n                        Files offer Vietnam-related documents through mid-1973, after which the\n                        Department captured memoranda, telegrams, and other records electronically.\u00a0\n                        Researchers can search and retrieve these later items through a National\n                        Archives archival database.\nBeginning in September 1973, when Kissinger became the Secretary of State,\n                        the Department again played an active role in the policymaking process.\u00a0 The\n                        Records of Henry Kissinger (26 Hollinger boxes), 1973\u20131977, Entry 5403,\n                        Record Group 59, at the National Archives contain documents related to\n                        Vietnam.\u00a0 The Transcripts of Secretary of State Kissinger\u2019s Staff Meetings\n                        (11 Hollinger boxes), Entry 5117, Record Group 59, are also useful.\u00a0\n                        Researchers may likewise consult the U.S. Foreign Service post records.\u00a0\n                        Although they offer little on high policy, the post files are filled with\n                        reports and communications on local conditions and activities.\u00a0 In the\n                        absence of U.S. initiative after mid-1973, moreover, the story of U.S.\n                        involvement in South East Asia often centers on embassy activity.\u00a0 The post\n                        files, however, provide inconsistent coverage of U.S. activities abroad\n                        because many records did not survive the fall of Saigon.\u00a0 The best\n                        preserved, the Phnom Penh Embassy Files, Record Group 84, offer detailed\n                        coverage of U.S. activities in Cambodia.\u00a0 Large portions of the Saigon\n                        Embassy collection, on the other hand, were lost in 1975.\u00a0 The most complete\n                        collection of Saigon Embassy documents for the period from 1974 to 1975 is\n                        located at the Ford Library, not the National Archives.\u00a0 Also, while they\n                        offer thin coverage of the years between 1969 and 1974, the Lot Files of the\n                        Bureau of East Asian Affairs Files, Record Group 59, can be useful for\n                        researchers interested in the ending of the Vietnam War.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records are essential for documenting\n                        the role of intelligence in the war in Southeast Asia.\u00a0 Even so, the most\n                        important finished intelligence can be found in the Nixon Presidential\n                        Materials, NSC Files.\u00a0 The CIA prepared a daily briefing for the President\n                        on Vietnam that is in the National Security Council Files, President\u2019s Daily\n                        Briefings.\u00a0 Additionally, useful collections under CIA\u2019s physical custody\n                        are the National Intelligence Center (NIC) Files, which contain many\n                        intelligence estimates and memoranda.\u00a0 Of particular significance are the\n                        records of George Carver, Special Assistant for the Director of Central\n                        Intelligence (DCI), for Vietnam Affairs.\u00a0 As the CIA\u2019s foremost Washington\n                        expert on Vietnam and Southeast Asia, his files are central to understanding\n                        the interplay between intelligence and foreign policy.\u00a0 The same is true for\n                        the DCI (Helms) Files and DCI Executive Registry Files, although these files\n                        also include material on non-Vietnam issues that engaged the DCI.\u00a0 The\n                        National Intelligence Council\u2019s Estimative Products on\n                        Vietnam, 1948\u20131975, published in 2005, contains a good selection of\n                        intelligence estimates on Vietnam.\u00a0 In most cases, Foreign\n                        Relations volumes print only the summaries of the National Intelligence\n                        and Special Intelligence estimates while the full texts are published in the\n                        in the NIC publication.\u00a0 Intelligence Files for the Nixon and Ford\n                        Administrations, including the records of the 303 Committee/40 Committee and\n                        related subject files for Vietnam and Southeast Asia were particularly\n                        valuable for documenting covert operations and unconventional warfare.\u00a0 They\n                        are currently in the custody of the National Security Council, but are\n                        destined for the Nixon and Ford Presidential Libraries.\u00a0 A Department of\n                        State Lot file, the INR/IL Historical Files, holds valuable material for\n                        these topics and is similar to the Nixon Intelligence Files.\u00a0 These files\n                        remain in the control of the Department of State.\nThe Department of Defense and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird were key\n                        players in the formation of policy towards Vietnam.\u00a0 Department of State\n                        historians conducted extensive research in the Department of Defense records\n                        now housed at the Washington National Records Center in Suitland, Maryland.\u00a0\n                        Still classified, these files include secret and top-secret documents,\n                        organized by office, year, and subject.\u00a0 These files will likely move to the\n                        National Archives in College Park upon declassification.\u00a0 The Defense\n                        Secretary\u2019s key memoranda are almost always in the NSC Files in the Nixon\n                        and Ford collections.\nAt the Ford Library, a collection of documents covers Laird\u2019s tenure as\n                        Secretary of Defense.\u00a0 His staff chose these Laird Papers at the end of his\n                        term as Secretary of Defense with a view to documenting his major decisions\n                        and accomplishments.\u00a0 The Papers of James R. Schlesinger, Secretary of\n                        Defense from 1973 to 1975, are located at the Library of Congress.\u00a0\n                        Schlessinger\u2019s collection holds memoranda, reports, and communications\n                        related to his government service, but is not yet open to the public.\u00a0 Major\n                        portions of the Laird and Schlesinger collections concern Vietnam, Cambodia,\n                        and POW/MIA affairs.\u00a0 In addition, the official files of the Secretary of\n                        Defense, Under Secretary of Defense, and their Assistants, plus the records\n                        of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs,\n                        have large sections devoted to Vietnam and Southeast Asia.\nDefense related records that were not available when the first volumes were\n                        being researched, but are worthy of mention as sources, are the records of\n                        the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in Record Group 218 at the National\n                        Archives\u2014specifically those of General Earle G. Wheeler, Chairman,\n                        1964\u20131970; Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, 1970\u20131974; and General George S. Brown,\n                        1974\u20131978\u2014in the National Archives.\u00a0 The most useful sections of these\n                        records are the Chairman\u2019s correspondence to and from the Commander,\n                        Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, correspondence to and from the\n                        Commander in Chief, Pacific Command, and additional miscellaneous Vietnam\n                        related documents in various country folders.\nAnother JCS collection, Admiral Moorer\u2019s Diary, reveals significant\n                        information about the policymaking process.\u00a0 Only made available when the\n                        final Foreign Relations volumes in the Vietnam series\n                        were being researched, the Diary contains entries for practically every day\n                        during his tour of duty as Chairman.\u00a0 Each day\u2019s entry contains a series of\n                        sub-entries about meetings (in his office, in Secretary Laird\u2019s, at the\n                        White House, or elsewhere), telephone conversations, or reflections on\n                        policy matters and other topics.\u00a0 Appended to most daily entries are one or\n                        more documents.\u00a0 Especially useful to the researcher are memoranda for the\n                        record Moorer drafted after meetings with President Nixon or with Kissinger,\n                        internal memoranda from one of his own subordinates or external ones from\n                        Kissinger or Kissinger\u2019s Deputy, Alexander M. Haig, or from other members of\n                        the Nixon Administration.\u00a0 What gives special value to the already immensely\n                        valuable diary and its attached documents is that Moorer taped and\n                        transcribed many of his telephone conversations and attached the transcripts\n                        to the Diary.\u00a0 These transcripts of conversation\u2014a few with Nixon but more\n                        often with Kissinger; Haig; Laird; Admiral John S. McCain (Commander in\n                        Chief, Pacific); Generals Creighton W. Abrams and Fred C. Weyand (theater\n                        commanders in Saigon); and the Admiral\u2019s own senior subordinate at the\n                        Pentagon\u2014reveal the extraordinary and substantial role Moorer played in the\n                        formation and implementation of U.S. national security policy in Southeast\n                        Asia.\nAfter February 1971, the White House Presidential Recordings are a critical\n                        source for understanding Vietnam policy developments and to a lesser extent\n                        for policy in Cambodia and Laos.\u00a0 The recordings that are transcribed and\n                        cited in the Foreign Relations volumes comprise only\n                        a small portion of the recordings available.\u00a0 Using the tape log, and\n                        comparing entries with the meetings and conversations for which there are\n                        written records, the editors and the Nixon Tape team at the Office of the\n                        Historian have selected policy-significant recordings of meetings and\n                        telephone conversations. While tape conversations are difficult to\n                        transcribe and do not always lend themselves easily to insertion in\n                        documentary publication, the selection presented in these volumes is a\n                        representative of the larger body of conversations. Nixon and his close\n                        confidants spent hours talking in the President\u2019s Oval and Executive Office\n                        Building office. Their conversations were often unstructured and repetitive,\n                        their language frank, raw, and often uncomplimentary to individuals and\n                        institutions.\u00a0 While it is the immediacy and apparent unguarded natured of\n                        recorded conversations, whether of individuals talking on a telephone or in\n                        an office, that give such conversations the reputation for truthfulness they\n                        enjoy among historians and others, it should be emphasized that it is just\n                        as possible to shade the truth, or lie, in conversations as it is in the\n                        more calculated act of writing.\u00a0 At the same time, when recordings exist, as\n                        the Nixon White House tapes do, they become an integral part of the\n                        historical record and impose on historians the obligation to exploit them as\n                        best they can.\u00a0 These tapes are an almost breathtaking resource but must be\n                        used with caution and viewed within the broader context.\u00a0 Volumes in the Foreign Relations series provide just such a context.\nWhat makes the Nixon administration\u2019s records on Vietnam especially revealing\n                        is the existence of these unique sources.\u00a0 The presidential tapes\n                        recordings, the Kissinger telephone conversations, the Haldeman Diaries, and\n                        the Moorer Diary and telephone conversations provide an added dimension of\n                        documentary material.\u00a0 Taken in conjunction with the more traditional\n                        records, these special sources deepen one\u2019s understanding of the characters\n                        involved and how they interacted with others and with the circumstances they\n                        encountered.\u00a0 By extension, they also provide a great understanding of the\n                        policymaking process.\nIn sum, the records of the Nixon and Ford administrations on Vietnam are a\n                        rich and abundant resource but pose some substantial challenges to\n                        researchers.\u00a0 Even with five volumes covering the conflict from 1969 to\n                        1975, only a small fraction of the total documentation will be printed in\n                        the Foreign Relations series.\u00a0 The editors of these\n                        volumes believe, however, that they have selected the most significant\n                        documents available for understanding the policy process.\u00a0 Furthermore, they\n                        have added value to their selections through annotation and editorial\n                        notes.\u00a0 While Department of State historians have had to make difficult\n                        choices, they believe that the resulting documentary collections provide a\n                        solid account of policy decisions by the Nixon and Ford Administrations on\n                        the Vietnam War and will stimulate additional research on U.S. involvement\n                        in the still-controversial war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Documents\n\n\nBrowse official documents from the published Foreign Relations of the United States series.\n\n\nBrowse by Administration\n\n\nPre-Truman Volumes\n\nTruman Administration\n\nEisenhower Administration\n\nKennedy Administration\n\nJohnson Administration\n\nNixon Administration\n\nFord Administration\n\nCarter Administration\n\nReagan Administration\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Resources\n\n\nMore about\n                                the Foreign Relations series\n\nStatus of the Series\n\nHistory of the Series\n\nForeign Relations Ebooks\n\nOther Electronic Resources for\n                                U.S. Foreign Relations\n\nGuide to Sources on\n                                Vietnam, 1969-1975\n\nTips for searching the Foreign Relations Series\n\nHow to cite Foreign Relations documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
