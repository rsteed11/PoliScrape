Copre 490. The Pre-Co delegations of the other American\nRepublics -at a meeting in the Chilean Embassy yesterday agreed to\nvote in favor of the US as UNO site. It had been apparent prior to\nour receipt of Preco 324 that confusion existed among these delega-\ntions as to our attitude, in fact this confusion, as evidenced by some of\ntheir instructions which they have shown us, was shared- by their own\ngovernments.\n  It seems more than likely that Bianchi (Chile), who says he had\nspecific instructions to take the lead, assumed the role of whip. A\nnumber of other delegates, however, particularly Zuleta (Colombia),\nwho on his own initiative asked us our position some days ago; and\nSalamanca (Bolivia), whose instructions require him to vote with\nthe majority of his Latin American colleagues; and one or two others,\nhave wanted us to understand their part in this decision. Our only\nresponse has been to repeat the statement authorized in the Depart-\nment\'s above-mentioned telegram. The Argentine delegate was care-\nful last night to stress to us the fact that his original instructions, since\nchanged, had been to vote for Europe.\n  Furthermore Riaz (Egypt) has in his own fashion led us to under-\nstand that the five Arab votes may be cast for the US.\n                                                         SEVENSON\n  61The Earl of Halifax, British Ambassador to the United States.\n  62In his personal telegram 12527, November 30, 6 P. m., to Secretary Byrnes,\nthe Ambassador in the United Kingdom (Winant) stated that he had not been\nable to give his concurrence to Mr. Stevenson\'s thinking on this point, in\nlight\nof the Department\'s position as set forth in telegram 10333, November 28.\nSpecifically the Ambassador believed that the question of location of the\nUnited\nNations should not be related to the current negotiations on loan and trade\nagreements. In the Department, Ambassador Winant was backed in this view\nby the Deputy Director of the Office of European Affairs (Hickerson) and\nthe\nUnder Secretary of State (Acheson), Mr. Hickerson writing, "I fully\nconcur\nin the Ambassador\'s statement that the British have every right to state\ntheir\nposition . . . Moreover, I do not see how the Secretary could take this up\nwith\nthe British Ambassador In the manner suggested without departing from our\npublicly stated position . . ."
