General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1309\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nestablished four power position. If it was essential to close the con-\nsultations that morning, the net result might be that there would be\nno departure from  this previous position. COMMANDER STASSEN\nthought that Mr. Hickerson\'s proposal likewise was not satisfactory\nbecause if Russia were to abstain, its abstention would "stick out like\na sore thumb". Commnander\' Stassen thought that the Delegation\nshould agree to a proposal whereby a revisionary convention -could be\ncalled\' by a majority vote of both. houses of the Organization. SEN-\nATOR CONNALLY urged that it might be more appropriate to provide\nfor rejection of such a convention by a majority vote and the.IDele-\ngation agreed to this suggestion. COMMANDER STASSEN thought that\nit might be possible to gain clearance from Moscow before the Com-\nmission Session the following week. MR. PASVOLSKY indicated that he\nwas in favor of Senator Connally\'s provision. He thought that an\nattempt should be made to have a revisionary convention in the tenth\nyear. If the members should reject a convention by a majority, there\nwould be no convention. If they did not reject such a convention the\nconference could be held between the tenth and twelfth years. 1M.\nROCKEFELLER declared that he wanted to go on record as supporting\nCommander Stassen in his emphasis on the important psychological\neffect of concession on this issue. He thought that if it would become\nnecessary, the United States should reserve the right of independent\naction. Mr. Rockefeller pointed out that the Russians had taken\nsuch a step on another issue.70 But COMMANDER STASSEN replied that\nno four power position had been established on the other question.\nDIsCUSSION BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF ANY MATTER WITHIN THE\n              SPHERE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n  SECRETARY STETTINIuS asked Mr. Dulles to present to the Delega-\ntion the third item on the agenda. MR. DumLES referred the Delega-\ntion to the document, "The American Position on the Right of the\nGeneral Assembly to Discuss any Matters Within the Sphere of In-\nternational Relations," US Gen 267.7\' Mr. Dulles observed that at\nthe previous meeting of the four presidents of the Conference, Am-\nbassador Gromyko had taken advantage of the occasion to indicate\nthat he could not accept the text of Chapter V, Section B, paragi\'aph 1\nas it had been accepted by Committee II/2.72 AMBASSADOR GROMYKO\nhad urged that there be held immediately a meeting of the Steering\nCommittee and it had only been after considerable pressure that he had\n70Agreement was reached at the Five-Power meetings on June 12, 6 p. m., and\nJune 13, 2: 30 p. m., on freedom of action with respect to the issues of\nwithdrawal\nand domestic jurisdiction;
