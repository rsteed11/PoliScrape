SOONG agreed with Mr. Stettinius saying that otherwise small\nnations would have no voice or chance at all.\n  MR. EDEN remarked that some states like Canada considered that\nthey were entitled to some recognition because of the contribution they\nhad made in the present war. MR. STETTINIUS said he recognized\nfully the great contribution which Canada had made.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY said that it seemed to him that one of the sub-\nstantial objections to this proposal was that it impinged upon the free-\ndom of the Assembly. There is already some resistance here and in\nthe country to the immense powers being conferred upon the perma-\nnent members of the Security Council. The British proposal would\naggravate that objection. Only those states which are strong and\npowerful would be given seats. It seemed to the Senator that if the\nAssembly was to be given power to elect the non-permanent members\nit should have the power to determine the conditions of election. If\nsuch a criterion as that proposed were meritorious it would appeal to\nthe Assembly. It seemed to him that small powers would raise serious\nobjections to the adoption of the proposal as it would be construed\nas a build-up of another favored group.\n  MR. SnENIUS said that he agreed with the Senator.\n  MR. EDEN thought that it would be desirable to give this subject\nmore thought.\n  MR. STETTINIUS called attention to the fact that it was after 11 o'clock\nand suggested adjournment until tomorrow morning.\nRSC Lot 60-D 224, Box 96: U.S. Cr.
