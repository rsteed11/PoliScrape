I said that in my judgment that type\nof consultation proved to be very useful at San Francisco and will\ncertainly have to continue in the organization itself. He said that\nthe objection to such consultation is, in large measure, a personal\nmatter with Noel-Baker but he thought that the difficulty is not really\na continuing one and will undoubtedly take care of itself when the\nSecurity Council begins operating.\n500.CC (P.C.) /10-1245: Telegram\nThe United States Representative on the Preparatory Commission\n               (Stettinius) to the Secretary of State\n                                  LONDON, October 12, 1946-noon.\n                                [Received October 12-10: 20 a. m.]\n  10659. Copre 231. Ambassador Massigli, who has recently re-\nturned from a short visit to Paris, told me Tuesday that he thought\nI was pressing too hard for speed in holding the organizing meeting\nof UN (United Nations) in December of this year. He pointed to\nthe suspension of the work of the Council of Foreign Ministers 35 and\nsuggested that until the Big Five could really get on a footing of com-\nplete collaboration, it would be very risky to hold the organizing meet-\ning of UN. He indicated that he thought it would be wise to postpone\ntemporarily the first meeting until January or later. He urged as\nan additional reason for postponement that it would be unwise to\nbring UN into being until the way was prepared for several other\nEuropean countries to be admitted as new members at the first meet-\ning. He mentioned specifically Portugal and Sweden.\n  I told him that our recent difficulties with the Russians in con-\nnection with the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers did not\nin my opinion provide a reason for postponing UN, on the contrary\nit made it even more necessary to bring UN into being immediately.\nIt is my understanding from my conversation with you before you\nleft that this also is your view. I would appreciate confirmation of\nthis fact, as this matter may well come up again before the end of\nExCom (Executive Committee) and I would like to feel certain\nthat the position I have taken has your full support.\n                                                        STENIFUS\n  35 For documentation regarding the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers\nat London, September 11-October 2, 1945, see vol.
