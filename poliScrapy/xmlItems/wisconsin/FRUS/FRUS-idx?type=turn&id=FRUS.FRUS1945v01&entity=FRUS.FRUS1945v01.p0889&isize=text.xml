In rethinking the matter we had decided to include an\nexception only for the second sentence of paragraph 1, Section C,\nChapter VIII.44 Then at Yalta Mr. Stettinius was asked by the\nPresident to make a statement on our voting compromise.45  The state-\nment by the Secretary, MR. Hiss said, saved the day. The Russians\nwere somewhat confused since Stalin was speaking from the text\noriginally sent him rather than from the revised text so that at this\nfirst session on voting no conclusive discussion took place. At the\nnext plenary session, however, Stalin had said he would accept the\ncompromise and Churchill said he also would accept it.46\n  THn SECRETARY said he wanted Mr. Hiss to bring out particularly\nthe question as to whether a state had a veto on the pacific settlement\nof a dispute to which it was not a party. MR. Hiss commented that\nin meeting the proposal that there should be a veto on all matters, we\nhad been able to cut out one slice, so that the veto power would not\napply to states involved in disputes under the provisions for peaceful\nsettlement. In all other respects, he said, the veto power remained\nunimpaired.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked whether the veto power applied under\nSection A of Chapter VIII. MR. Hiss replied that, except where a\nstate was a party to a dispute, the veto power applied. SENATOR CON-\nNALLY asked whether Mr. Hiss agreed with Sir Alexander Cadogan\'s\ninterpretation that the veto power did not apply under paragraphs\n1 and 3 of Section A. MR. Hiss said he had not known of this itter-\npretation. SENATOR CONNALLY- reported that we were really in quite\na fix in Committee III/1 where a definite attack was being made on\nthe veto power in connection with the settlement of disputes.47 MR.\nNO[R- agreed with Mr. Hiss that the Yalta agreement implied a veto\nbeginning with -paragraph 1-the stage of investigation. MR. Hiss\nstated that, if any country thoight it had a case, it could raise the\nmatter with the Security Council and presumably the Council could\ntake jurisdiction of the case. Moreover, in the course of discussion it\nwould be quite normal for the Council to go into the facts of the\ncase and there would be considerable freedom for the Council to fix\nits own -rules and determine what came within the procedural vote.\nA thorough investigation, however, would probably come within the\nveto. MR. BLOOM said that the vote might well be taken after an\ninvestigation had taken place. MR. Hiss thought that the veto would\napply unless matters were construed to be procedural, and he em-\n44 See letter of January 14 from the Acting Counselor of the British Embassy\n(Wright) to Mr. Pasvolsky, Conferences at Malta and Yalta, p. 77; for Mr.\nPasvolsky\'s reply dated January 17, see ante, p. 22.\n"See Conferences at Malta and Yalta, pp. 661 and 682-686.\n"Ibid., pp. 712-713.\n47 See Doe. 486, 111/1/24, May 22, UNCIO Documents, vol. 11, p. 347.\n827\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0889&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0889&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0889&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0889&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0889&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0889&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0889&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0888&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0890&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0888&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0890&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0889&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
