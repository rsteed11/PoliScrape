These questions, he added, pertain to the increase of the-\nAssembly\'s competence in relation to the Security Council on security\nmatters under Chapter V, Section B, paragraph 1. MR. JOHNSON\nannounced that Committee III/3 had already voted on proposition 6..\nMR. SANDIFER indicated that Committee II/2 had defeated proposition\n1 at its last meeting. MR. NOTTER pointed out that proposition 3 should\nbe referred to the Committee of Five since an important principle was\ninvolved in the relationship of the, General Assembly and the Se-\ncurity Council. THE SECRETARY suggested that we could very quickly\napprove propositions 2, 5 and 9 and vote negatively on all of the\nothers.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG raised a question in regard to No. 9. He\nwondered whether we should vote "yes" on the question, since the\nsponsoring power amendment for both paragraphs 1 and 6 largely\ncovered the principle contained in that proposition. MR. DuLLas-\nasserted that the new amendment proposed by Canada would provide\nample coverage for this point, especially if it were taken in conjunc-\ntion with the two sponsoring power amendments. SENATOR VANDEN-\nBERG made it clear that he wanted the General Assembly to exercise\nthe authority suggested by the phrase "to discuss any matter affecting\ninternational relations" and agreed with other comments to the effect\nthat the two sponsoring power amendments approximated that goal\n  It was agreed that there was no issue of importance in connection\nwith paragraph 8 of Chapter V, Section B. It was the consensus\nof the group also that the sponsoring power amendment for para--\ngraph 6 covers all other amendments for that paragraph.\nCONSIDERATION OF RECOMMENDATION TO THE UNITED STATES DELEGA-\n    TION ON BASIC ISSUES (ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COOPERATION)\n    (COMMITTEE II/3, US GEN 114)\n  Mn. SANDIFER asked Mr. Kotschnig to present the recommendations\nof Committee II/3 on economic and social cooperation. MR. KOT--\nSCHNIG read the first item in which it is recommended that our Dele-\ngation oppose any special mention of the International Labor\nOrganization in the Charter. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE reported a very\nactive debate on this issue in the afternoon session.7  She believed\nthat if the issue came to a vote now, the vote would be quite close.\nThe United Kingdom is standing strongly for mention of the orga--\nnization in the Charter and she has strong support from many other\npowers. The issue seems to have gotten into the emotions of some of\nthe Delegates. They will not back down willingly on the stand that\nthey have taken. It was the belief of Dean Gildersleeve that the\nproblem should be referred to the Subcommittee of Five for solution.\n75 Doc. 381, II/3/16, May 17, UNCIO Documents, vol. 10, p. 40.\n764,\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0826&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0826&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0826&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0826&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0826&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0826&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0826&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0825&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0827&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0825&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0827&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0826&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
