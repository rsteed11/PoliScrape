General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 542\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked whether the Delegates agreed on calling\na press conference for Friday morning at 10 o\'clock. All except Rep-\nresentative Bloom agreed....\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said she supported communicating our proposals\nto the other Delegates no later than to the press. SENATOR VANDEN-\nBERG said it should have been done already. MR. PASvOLSEY said that\n-we have to reach some agreement with the other sponsoring nations\nand it would be best if all four would put out their proposals at the\nsame time. SENATOR VANDENBERG said he was willing to concede Mr.\nPasvolsky\'s point about courtesy to the other Delegates.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY thought the best way would be to decide tonight\n-that this was the American program and then in the morning or after-\nnoon of the next day to send it to the Secretary General and to the\npress. SENATOR CONNALLY said that was difficult because the Delega-\ntion had just authorized several of its members to negotiate with the\nRussians and British on some of these points. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM\nstill thought we should put it out as our program and make it clear\nthat some modifications might have to be made as a result of consulta-\ntions. MR. ARmsTRONG thought that if that plan was followed the\npress conference could be held on Thursday, and that would delight\nand surprise the press.\n  MR. SANDIFER said there were some mechanical problems because\nthere would have to be about 600 copies turned out. SENATOR CoN-\nNALLY said it was necessary to keep in mind the facilities for a job of\nthis sort. MR. MAcLEIsH said he wanted to announce to the press that\nit had been decided to hold a conference on Friday morning at 10\n,o\'clock. SENATOR CoNNALLY said that without opposition Mr. Mac-\nLeish would be authorized to announce a press conference for Friday\nmorning at 10 o\'clock. SENATOR CONNALLY called upon Mr. Pasvolsky\nto proceed with the business.\n  Withdrawal ProviSion.-SENATOR VANDENBERG said there was still\nsomething to be done on the withdrawal provision. MR. PASVOLESK\nremarked the best thing to do was to say to the Russians and British\nthat there was another point on which we wanted to make a proposal\nand that we were working on a text which would be shown to them\nlater. COMMANDER STASSEN said he wanted it understood that the\nUnited States was not to take the initiative in proposing a withdrawal\nprovision. SENATOR VANDENBERG said the Delegation had agreed not\nto include it in the "A" document but had put it into the "B"\ndocument.\nCOMMANDER STAssEN said there had not been a clear decision on that\npoint. MR. PASVOLSKY said that we could tell the others tonight that\nwe would like to see some provision about withdrawal. MR. STAssEN\nsaid he was against having a withdrawal clause introduced by a nation\nthat was going to have a veto in the Security Council. MR. Du-NN\nsaid the matter would have to be decided before Friday.
