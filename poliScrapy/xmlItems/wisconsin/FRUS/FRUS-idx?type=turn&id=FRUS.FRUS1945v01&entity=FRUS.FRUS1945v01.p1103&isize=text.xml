General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1041\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nparties to the regional pact, only. In this way, MR. DuLLES declared,\nit would be possible seriatim to terminate all. the regional treaties with\nthe consent of the parties thereto. The new draft, he said, added to\nthe number of nations whose consent would be required. If it were\npossible to limit the number of nations whose consent was necessary\nto two,\' why should there be additions made. to the Powers who could\nblock transferral of power.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN declared that he was willing- to compromise\non the use of the words "parties and permanent members of the Secu-\nrity Council". COMMANDER STASSEN said that he never wanted the\nUnited States to be excluded from the consultation concerning the\ntransferral of authority to the Organization. MR. IDULLES thought\nthat even without specific reference to the United States in any way,\nthis country would still have to be included in the consultation, because\nof its interest in this transferral of power resulting from the member-\nship of the United States on the Security Council. MR. IDULLES did\nnot, however, want the- United States "cut in" on the side which\ncould\nblock the transferral of power. COMMANDER STASSEN agreed that the\nUnited States would be able to participate on these decisions, as a\nresult of its membership on the Security Council. He wanted to\ninsure, however, that the United States would be able to initiate such\nactions. MR. DUJLLES commented that under the earlier wording, a\nrequest for the transferral of powers could be initiated by the two\nparties to any regional agreement, and would require the approval\nof only three or four others on the Security Council; the new draft\nwould merely add to the number of states whose approval would be\nrequired and would constitute an additional obstacle to turning over\nthe necessary authority. COMMANDER STASSEN declared that he did\nnot think that Mr. Dulles\' interpretation was correct, but since there\nwas some doubt, COMMANDER STASSEN declared that he was willing\nto attempt wording that would clarify the situation. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN asked the Delegation to consider, as an example, what would\nhave been the situation if the conflict in Syria and Lebanon had oc-\ncurred instead in Italy. COMMANDER STASSEN declared that under\nsuch conditions, he would not want the United States to be cut out of\nthe decisions that would be made.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY remarked that he was afraid that Mr. Dulles\' in-\nterpretation would not be accepted by the other four members of the\nBig Five. It-had been clear in the discussions, he said, that the act\nof superseding the authority of the regional pacts would require the\nconsent of the parties in the two categories, signatories and those\nhaving responsibility under Paragraph 2 of Chapter XII. MR. PAS-\nVOLSKY declared that the Big Five would not accept consent by only\ntwo powers for the Security Council\'s assuming these functions.
