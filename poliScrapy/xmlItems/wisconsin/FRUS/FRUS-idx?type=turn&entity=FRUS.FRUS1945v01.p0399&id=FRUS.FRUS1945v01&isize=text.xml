SENATOR CONNALLY asked why the As-\nsembly by itself could not adopt proposals. MR. PAsVOLSKY replied\nthat there would be strong objection to having the Assembly alone\npossess this power, since the permanent members of the Council\nwould then have no special position with respect to the making of\namendments.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY pointed out that as suggested by MR.- STASsEN,\nit would be more difficult to get a revision ratified than it would be\nto get an amendment ratified since an amendment would require rati-\nfication by members of the Organization having peinAnent member-\nship on the Security Council and by the majority of the other\nMembers of the Organization. According to Mr. Stassen's amend-\nment proposal, ratification of proposed revisions would require two-\nthirds of the Members including the permanent Members of the Secu-\nrity Council. He thought this point should be borne in mind in the\ndrafting and MR. PASvOLSKY agreed with him.\n                WrrminwAL FroM MErwnmisr\n  MR. PASVOLSKY asked the Delegation whether a provision for with-\ndrawal should be included. He noted that such a provision had been\nremoved from the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals on our own recom-\nmendation and that it was primarily a political question.88\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked Mr. Pasvolsky what his suggestion\nwas. MR. PASVOLSKY replied that, so far, no provision for with-\ndrawal was being suggested. MR. STASSEN commented that a provi-\nsion for withdrawal would affect, in fact, only the smaller states who\nmight find it desirable to withdraw if a veto of one of the permanent\nmembers tied up action of the Organization. He suggested that this\nGovernment should not put forward a provision for withdrawal but\nlet the--small nations if they wished make the suggestion themselves.\nMR. STASSEN thought that it might be well to have a provision for\neOsy withdrawal. Mi. PAsvoLsKY replied that since this is ahi Orga-\nnizationr based on the unity of the great powers, he did not think\nthe great powers would be willing to make possible easy withdrawal.\nREPRESENTATIVE EATON said that if a provision for easy withdrawal\nwas stipulated, the conditions leading up to, the breakdown of the\nL6ague of Nations would be reproduced. SENAToR CONNALLY thought\nit would be difficult to hold within the Organizatioh states that really\nwanted to get out.\n  MI. BOWMAN remarked that it was important to keep in mind the\nunnumbered paragraph at the end of the Chapter on Principles, in\nwhich it was provided that states not members of the Organization\n  ' For previous discussion of this question, see minutes of the meeting\nof the\ndelegation, April 11, 9 a. m., p. 241; see also progress report of August\n25, 1944,\non the Dumbarton Oaks Conversations, Foreign Relations, 1944, vol.
