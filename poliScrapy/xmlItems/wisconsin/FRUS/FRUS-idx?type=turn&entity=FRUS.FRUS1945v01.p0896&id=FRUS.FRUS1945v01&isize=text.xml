The IUnited States delegation there-\nfore devised the following compromise proposal which was to be\ninserted as a new paragraph 12 at the end of Chapter VIII, Section B.\n  "Should the Security Council not succeed in preventing aggression,\nand should aggression occur by any state against any member state,\nsuch member state possesses the inherent right to take necessary\nmeasures for self-defense. The right to take such measures for self-\ndefense against armed attack shall also apply to understandings or\narrangements like those embodied in the Act of Chapultepec, under\nwhich all members of a group of states agree to consider an attack\nagainst any one of them as an attack against all of them. The taking\nof such measures shall be immediately reported to the Security Coun-\ncil and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility\nof the Security Council under this charter to take at any time such\naction as it may deem necessary in order to maintain or restore inter-\nnational peace and security."\n  When this proposal, however, was placed before the other members\nof the Big Five, the British reacted very unfavorably, expressing the\nview that it went too far in yielding to the proponents of regionalism\nand it would undermine in a dangerous fashion the strength of the\ninternational organization. They, therefore, proposed an alternative\ntext which was satisfactory to the American delegation. The text\nread as follows:\n  "Nothing in this charter impairs the inherent right of self-defense,\neither individual or collective, in the event that the Security Council\nhas failed to maintain international peace and security and an armed\nattack against a member state has occurred. Measures taken in the\nexercise of this right shall be immediately reported to the Security\nCouncil and shall not be in any way affect the authority and responsi-\nbility of the Security Council under this charter to take at any time\nsuch action as it may deem necessary in order to maintain or restore\ninternational peace and security."\n  In accepting this British draft for a new paragraph at the end of\nChapter VIII, Section B, the U.S. delegation also originally intended\nthat there should be inserted in paragraph 1, Chapter VIII, Section\nC after the words "nothing in the charter should preclude the exist-\nence of regional arrangements or agencies" the words "or collective\narrangements like that contemplated by the Act of Chapultepec."\nIt was felt that the explicit mention of the Act of Chapultepec would\nbe a gesture which would be appreciated by the Latin Americans and\nthat it would furthermore serve as a concrete example of the type\nof beneficent regional arrangement which we had in mind.
