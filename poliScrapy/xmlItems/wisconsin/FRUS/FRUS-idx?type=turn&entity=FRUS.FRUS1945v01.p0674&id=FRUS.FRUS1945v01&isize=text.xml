I\non the question. MR. MOLOTOV said that the Soviet Delegation found\nitself in a special position in this matter and that they felt that it was\nimportant to take up the matter with the French Delegation. Further-\nmore, he said, this amendment had only just been submitted to him\nfor study and that he felt that he would need more time to consider it.\nOn the other hand, he pointed out that if the other three Delegations\nwere willing to accept the Soviet amendment they could reach agree-\nment immediately.\n  MR. STmmNius said that under the circumstances, since the- British\nand Chinese Delegations had accepted this latter proposal as modified,\nhe would be willing to have the proposal submitted by the three of\nthem. MR. MoLoTov said that the Soviet Delegation did not want\nto lag behind but that they would need at least 24 hours to study this\nquestion. MR. STEMNIUS said that, unfortunately, all amendments\nhad to be submitted to the Conference by midnight, and that if the\namendment were not submitted it would not be available for considera-\ntion.\n  To resolve this difficulty, MR. STEMNIUS suggested that each of the\nDelegations might put in its own amendment. In this same connection,\nhe raised the question of the further action that might be taken with\nrespect to the amendment to Chapter V, Section B, paragraph 6.\nMR. MOLOTOV said that he would like to study this proposal further;\nthat on the whole, he found it acceptable and that it met the principal\nSoviet points, but that he would like to have the opportunity to study\nit a little further.\n  To bring the meeting to a close, THE SECRETARY then suggested that\nall of those amendments upon which they had found themselves in\nagreement would be submitted as joint proposals. Those amendments\nupon which they had found themselves in disagreement could then\nbe submitted individually by each of the Delegations,4 with the hope\nthat the consultations on them could continue at a later state [stage?]\nin the Conference.\n  Thereupon, the meeting adjourned at 11: 15 p. m.\n500.CC/5-64-5 Telegram\nThe Chairmran of the United State8 Delegation (Stettinius) to the\n                    Acting Secretary of State\n                                     SAN FRANCISCO, May 6, 1945.\n                                     [Received May 6-4: 09 a. m.]\n  1.
