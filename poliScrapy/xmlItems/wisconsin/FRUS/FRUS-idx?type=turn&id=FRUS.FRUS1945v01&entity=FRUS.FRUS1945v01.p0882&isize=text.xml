General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 820\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 a5, VOLUME I\nTHE SECRETARY replied that this was basic and that under the proposals\nour forces would not be used without the consent of the United States.\nWe would have a veto on their use.\n  THE SECRETARY asked whether all the members of the Delegation\nwould be willing to give Mr. Pasvolsky authority to go forward and\nnegotiate this agreement. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said she was "satis-\nfied". MR. BLOOM indicated that it was "okay". THE SECRETARY\nre-\nplied that the decision was unanimous as always, or rather as usual.\nMR. STASSEN said that it looked 100% good to him.\n  THE SECRETARY said he did not want the draft shown to the Latin\nAmerican foreign ministers for the present but that arrangements\nshould be made promptly to discuss the question with them. MR.\nPASVOLSKY pointed out that in the end it was quite possible that the\nregional arrangements provisions would be in an article by themselves\nbut that of course this remained to be decided and negotiated.\n         PROCEDURE FOR DEALING WITH REGIONAL DEArrs\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG asked what procedure would now be followed\nin committees to handle these drafts. MR. JOHNSON said it was our\nunderstanding that all three drafts would be discussed and voted on\nin Committee II1/4, which would then report to Commission III and\nfor their information only would report the matter to Committees 2\nand 3 of Commission III. MR. JOHNSON said it had been recom-\nmended in a previous draft to the Delegates, a draft which had not\nbeen discussed, however, that Senator Vandenberg\'s committee 37\nshould handle the whole problem. SENATOR VANDENBERG indicated\nthat this procedure satisfied him completely. THE SECRETARY asked\nMr. Sandifer for his views. MR. SANDIFER thought Mr. Johnson\'s\nproposal was good and the procedure was then generally agreed to.\nDIscUsSION OF ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH PROPOSED BY SOVIET UNION IN\n                    CHAPTER VIII, SECTION C\n  MR. PASVOLSKY stated that a brief discussion was necessary on the\nnew sentence proposed by the Soviet Union for addition to paragraph\n1 of Chapter VIII, Section C. This paragraph read, "This paragraph\nby no means prejudices paragraphs 1 and 2, Section A of this Chap-\nter, which fully preserve their power." MR. PASVOLSKY proposed\nthat a revision of this sentence be used which he thought would be\nmore satisfactory. This revision was before the members in a draft\nentitled "Additional sentence to paragraph 1 of Section C, Chapter\nVIII, May 19, 1945." The draft read "This paragraph in no way\nimpairs the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section A of this\nChapter". MR. PASVOLSKY explained that the Soviet representatives\nhad felt it was important to put in this paragraph in order to safe-\n  3T Committee III/4.\n82)0\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0882&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0882&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0882&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0882&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0882&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0882&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0882&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0881&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0883&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0881&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0883&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0882&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
