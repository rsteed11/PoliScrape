The Secre-\ntary opened the conversation by referring to Ambassador Gromyko\'s\nrequest made earlier in the week69 for a memorandum on tentative\narrangements for the San Francisco Conference. The Secretary\nthen handed to Ambassador Gromyko a copy of a memorandum on\nthat subject and handed another copy to Lord Halifax.70 A copy\nof the memorandum is attached hereto.71\n  The Secretary then said that it had occurred to him that there\nwould be so many questions relating to the arrangements during the\nnext few weeks that it would be very helpful if an informal steering\ncommittee composed of himself and the two Ambassadors could be\nformed.72  He said that perhaps the Department could undertake\nrelated consultation with the Chinese Ambassador. He emphasized\nthat he was making this suggestion from the point of view of con-\nvenience of the other sponsoring governments and he made it clear, in\nresponse to inquiries, that the committee would deal with questions\nof procedure and arrangements rather than of substance. It was\nagreed, however, that if the committee were established it would serve\nas a means of transmission and communication on matters of policy\nconnected with the Conference.\n  Ambassador Gromyko said that the proposal seemed to him to be\na good idea and Lord Halifax also indicated his agreement. They\nboth said that they would take the matter up with their Governments\nand let us have a prompt reply. It was further understood that each\nof the Ambassadors would nominate a deputy for liaison with the\nDepartment on these matters.\n  The Secretary said that through the proposed informal steering\ncommittee and liaison with the nominated deputies of the Ambas-\nsadors it would be possible to go over maps, charts and other plans\nfor the arrangements and later to discuss which countries might be\nproposed for various commission and committee positions. He said\nthat he thought it would be helpful if the sponsoring governments\ncould agree on these matters in advance of the Conference.\n  69 Memorandum of conversation, by the Secretary of State, March 13, not\nprinted.\n  7 A copy of the memorandum was transmitted also to the Chinese Ambassador\n(Wei).\n  The text of the memorandum was -transmitted to London in telegram 2(098,\nrepeated on the same date to Moscow as telegram 637, and to Chungking as\ntele-\ngram 462.\n   Infra.\n   T2The so-called "Informal Organizing Group on Arrangements for the\nSan\nFrancisco Conference", composed of the Secretary of State and the British,\nSoviet, and Chinese Ambassadors, held its first meeting April 3, 1945, the\nsecond\nApril 10, and last April 13.\n129\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
