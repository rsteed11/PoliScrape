He asked the Delegation to\nthink over whether this would be a good procedure.\nChapter II: Principles\n  MIR. DuuLTzs questioned what this chapter was intended to accom-\nplish and said that he did not understand what the principles were.\nIn part they were long-range purposes and in part, specific under-\ntakings by the member governments. He thought that they were\nextremely dangerous in their present form, and he did not see what\nrole they were supposed to play. In particular, he said, the looseness\nof the commitments bothered him; e.g., all members undertake to give\nevery assistance or they undertake not to give any assistance. What,\nhe asked, does this mean? He thought it was most important to\nclear up the confusion involved in this chapter.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG asked what the difference was between the\npurposes and principles of the Organization. MR. PAsvOiSKY ex-\nplained that the principles were rules of action, whereas the purposes\nwere the aims of action. MR. PAsVOmIKY added that paragraph 5\nneeded to be redrafted since all members would give every assistance\nin accordance with the provisions of the charter. MR. DuuLEs re-\nmarked that he did not know what was meant by the term "principle"\nand that he thought the rather generalized and vague commitments\nin that chapter might jeopardize getting the charter through the\nSenate. He referred in particular to the obligation to settle disputes\nby peaceful means. MR. PASVOLSKY said this meant that states\nwould use none but peaceful means in the settlement of their disputes.\n  MR. PAsvoLsKY added that the next paragraph obligated members\nof the Organization to refrain from the use of force no matter what\nhappened in settling their disputes. SENATOR CONNALLY thought\nthis was just another statement of the Kellogg-Briand Pact.70 MR.\nDuLus thought that this statement was already implicit in the pre-\nceding paragraph. MR. PASVOLSKY commented that there were two\nobligations: the positive one to settle disputes by peaceful means and\nthe negative one not to use force in settling disputes.\n  MBt. ACHESON pointed out that there were two types of principles\nincluded in this chapter, e.g., the basis of the Organization on the\nprinciple of sovereign equality and the enumeration of the obligations\nof members. He felt that the chapter needed to be very carefully\nconsidered. MR. Du-LLES agreed and pointed out that he was afraid\nthat this chapter would be taken as just another chapter of principles\nin the French meaning of the term, to accept "en principe".
