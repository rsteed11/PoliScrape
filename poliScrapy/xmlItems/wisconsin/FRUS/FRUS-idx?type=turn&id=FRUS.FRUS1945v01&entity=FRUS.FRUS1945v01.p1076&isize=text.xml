General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1014\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\neration of ,the four Delegations, it was clear that all items under\nChapter VI, Section D, would be determined by a procedural vote\nof the Council as well as the question as to whether a matter should\nbe discussed and considered, by the Council. Moreover, if it, were\nspecified in the Charter that (a) Chapter VI, Section D, (b) the\nright to discuss and consider questions in the Security Council, (c)\nthe convocation of the General Assembly, and (d) the calling of a\nconference for revision of the Charter, all were to be decided by a\nprocedural vote of the Council, then the sponsoring Governments\nwould be in a strong position to state the answer to question no. 19\nalong the lines he had indicated.\n  On the other hand, if it were merely stated in the Charter that the\ndetermination as to whether a matter was of a procedural or non-\nprocedural nature was to be made by a qualified majority vote, then\nthe sponsoring Governments would be in a very weak position in so far\nas defending the Yalta formula was concerned.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky stressed the fact that, in his opinion, the Conference\nwas not against the Yalta formula as a whole, but that it opposed\nthe application of that formula' on some of the smaller points. He\ncompared the Yalta voting formula with the voting procedure in the\nCouncil of the League of Nations, pointing out that fundamental dif-\nferences between the two made off-hand comparisons of them some-\nwhat difficult. He said that,-since under the Yalta formula unanimity\namong the permanent members is required only under certain circum-\nstances, it was important to show clearly where the unanimity rule\nwould apply and where it would not apply. If it were to be left to\nthe future for the Security Council to determine this question, there\nwas the risk that the Council might be practically immobilized in an\neffort to settle it.\n  Therefore, to summarize, Mr. Pasvolsky suggested that it should\nbe a matter of agreement now among the sponsoring Governments\nthat a procedural vote applied to: (a) Chapter VI, Section D, (b)\nthe right to discuss and consider any matter before the Council, (c)\nthe convocation of a General Assembly or of a General Conference foi\nrevising the Charter, and (d) the election of judges to the Court.\n                       ELECTION OF JUDGES\n  In connection with the election of judges, Mr. Pasvolsky said that\nsince the Court did not have compulsory jurisdiction, he did not feel\nthat the election of judges should be subject to the veto of any one\nof the permanent members of the Security Council.\n          ELECTION OF SECRETARY GENERAL AND DEPUTIES\n  With regard to the election of the Secretary General, Mr. Pasvolsky\nsaid that there was agreement with the Soviet Delegation that the\n1014\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
