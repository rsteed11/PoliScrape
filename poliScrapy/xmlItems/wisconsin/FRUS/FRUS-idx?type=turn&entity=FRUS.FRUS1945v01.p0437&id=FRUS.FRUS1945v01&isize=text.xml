He thought particularly that we should be aware of the\ndifficulties involved since to put the emphasis upon the possibilities,\nof change would tend to take the lid off the box. He questioned\nwhether the reference in the first argument to the modification of\nboundaries was wise. It would seem to give opportunities to statea\nto revise boundaries.\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON asked why New Zealand favored this par-\nticular principle. MR. PASVOLSKY replied that this principle was\nfavored by the New Zealand Minister in Washington83 who felt that\nthe Dumbarton Oaks Proposals did not go far enough to guarantee\nthe boundaries of states. He did not believe however, that the New\nZealand argument needed to be taken too seriously. MR. ARMSTRONG\nthought it was important in arguing for our position not to say any-\nthing that would give the impression that we favored a change of\nboundaries. He was afraid this would open the door to a difficult\nsituation.\n  MR. STASSEN asked whether the Act of Chapultepec did not guaran-\ntee the territorial integrity of states in this hemisphere. MR.

SENATOR VANDENBERG noted that this,\nsubject fell within the jurisdiction of Committee 1 of Commission I.\nMIR. DULiES commented that this was a most delicate problem.\n  DEAN GiLDESLEEVE suggested that Air. Bowman prepare a, formula\nalong the lines he had suggested and submit it to Committee 1 for\nconsideration. MR. PASVOIASKY\'S suggestion for the argumentation\non the principle of territorial integrity was accepted generally by the\nDelegates.\n                   CHAPTER III-MEMBERSHIP\n  MR. PASVOLSKY commented that the main proposal on membership\nthat we would wish to counter was the suggestion of the principle\nof universal membership. According to this principle all states would\n88 . A.
