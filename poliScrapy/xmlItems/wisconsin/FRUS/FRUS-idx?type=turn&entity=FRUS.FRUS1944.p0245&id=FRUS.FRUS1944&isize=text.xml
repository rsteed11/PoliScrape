The only way of bringing material help quickly to the Poles\nfighting in Warsaw would be for United States aircraft to drop sup-\nplies using Russian airfields for the purpose. Seeing how much is in\njeopardy we beg that you will again consider the big stakes involved.\nCould you not authorize your Air Forces to carry out this operation,\nlanding if necessary on Russian airfields without their formal consent?\nIn view of our great successes in the west, I cannot think that the Rus-\nsians could reject this fait accompli. They might even welcome it as\ngetting them out of an awkward situation. We would of course share\nfull responsibility with you for any action taken by your Air Force.5\n                                                             PRIME\n   Roosevelt, by telegram No. BLUE 139, directed Leahy to take the subject\nmatter\nof this telegram up with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and with Hull and to prepare\na reply. A draft reply, approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department\nof State, was forwarded to the President at Hyde Park on September 5 in tele-\ngram No. RED 374, and was approved by Roosevelt without change (telegram\nNo.\nBLUE 140). For the text of the reply, see post, p. 190.\nRoosevelt Papers: Telegram\n        Prime Minister Churchill to President Roosevelt 1\nTOP SECRET                            LONDON, 4th September 1944.\n  Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. Personal and top secret.\nNumber 780.\n  Following is text of telegram sent to Moscow this evening mentioned\nin my immediately preceding telegram:-\n  "1. The War Cabinet at their meeting today considered the latest\nreports of the situation in Warsaw which show that the Poles fighting\nagainst the Germans there are in desperate straits.\n  2. The War Cabinet wish the Soviet Government to know that\npublic opinion in this country is deeply moved by the events in War-\nsaw and by the terrible sufferings of the Poles there. Whatever the\nrights and wrongs about the beginnings of the Warsaw rising, the\npeople of Warsaw themselves cannot be held responsible for the de-\ncision taken. Our people cannot understand why no material help has\nbeen sent from outside to the Poles in Warsaw. The fact that such help\ncould not be sent on account of your Government\'s refusal to allow\nUnited States aircraft to land on aerodromes in Russian hands is now\nbecoming publicly known. If on top of all this the Poles in Warsaw\nshould now be overwhelmed by the Germans, as we are told they must\nbe within two or three days, the shock to public opinion here will be\nincalculable. The War Cabinet themselves find it hard to understand\nyour Government\'s refusal to take account of the obligations of the\nBritish and American Governments to help the Poles in Warsaw.\nYour Government\'s action in preventing this help being sent seems\n  \'Sent to Washington by the United States Military AttacI16, London, via\nArmy\n  channels; forwarded by the White House Map Room to Roosevelt, who was then\n  at Hyde Park, as telegram No. RED 370.\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0010.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0010.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0245&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0245&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0245&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0245&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0245&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0245&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0245&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0010.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0102&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0244&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0246&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0010.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0102&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0244&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0246&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0245&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
