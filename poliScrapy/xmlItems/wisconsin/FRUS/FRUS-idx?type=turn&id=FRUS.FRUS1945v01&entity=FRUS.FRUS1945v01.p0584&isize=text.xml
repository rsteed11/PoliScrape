General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 522\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1 9 4 5, VOLUME I\nIn response to Senator Connally\'s inquiry, the Delegation unani-\nmously agreed to adopt the recommendation to insert "General As-\nsembly" in Chapter VIII, Section A, paragraph 6, second sentence.\n    CLEARANCE OF TE UNITED STATES DRAFT OF CHAr1ER VII\n MR. HACKWoRTI asked if the Delegation would have to clear the\n draft of Chapter VII of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals with the\n other three sponsoring powers, or if it could come out of the Fourth\n Commission. He asked for Dr. Pasvolsky\'s view on this matter. DR.\n PASVOLSKY thought it was proper for Commission IV to make this\n recommendation in order to bring Chapter VII of the proposals\n in conformity with the statute of the court. He did not think that\nthis required conversation between the four sponsoring powers; but\nfelt that it could properly come up in Committee 1 of Commission IV.\nCOMMANDER STASSEN asked if we should not at least inform the other\npowers as to our suggestions. DR. PASVOLSKY proposed that Mr.\nHackworth get in touch with the representatives of those other powers\nwho were on Committee 1 of Commission IV. He did not think this\nshould be sent to the Steering Committee because it was not a formal\nproposal of an amendment and was not subject to the Friday dead-\nline. He felt that this was a proposal which emerged out of the work\nof the Committee of Jurists. MR. HACKWORTH thought it was largely\na drafting matter for Commission IV.\n  MR. NOrER noted that the recommendation that the General As-\nsembly be empowered to ask for advisory opinions constituted an\namendment to the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. MR. FAHY thought\nthat Mr. Notter had a point, in that this was a substantive change, but\nobserved that the Netherlands Delegation is making this proposal.\nSENATOR CONNALLY commented that Dr. Pasvolsky\'s idea was that a\nreport of Commission IV to the Conference could cover this matter.\nDR. PASVOLSKY thought that Commission IV could merely report that\nthese changes were necessary to bring the Charter into conformity\nwith the Statute of the Court.\n      REFERENCE TO THE COURT IN CHAPTER VIII, SECTION A\n  MR. DuLLEs thought that paragraph 6 of Chapter VIII, Section A,\nshould be moved into Chapter VII of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals,\nsince this paragraph related to the court, and Chapter VIII, Sec-\ntion A, seemed to relate to the pacific settlement of disputes by the\nSecurity Council. MIR. HACKWORTH pointed out that Chapter VIII,\nSection A, covers the whole structure of pacific settlement of inter-\nnational disputes, and that the court is one of the principal means of\npacific settlement in addition to such procedures as negotiation, con-\nciliation and arbitration. While paragraph 6 of Section A relates\nto judicial settlement of disputes, he observed that this is an elabora-\ntion of paragraph 3 of Chapter VIII, Section A. He thought that\n522\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0584&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0584&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0584&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0584&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0584&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0584&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0584&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0583&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0585&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0583&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0585&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0584&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
