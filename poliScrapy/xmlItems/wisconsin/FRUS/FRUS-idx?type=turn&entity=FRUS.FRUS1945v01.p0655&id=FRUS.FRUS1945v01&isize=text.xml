MR. STASSEN remarked\nthat no effort should be made to define the right of self-defense since\nto define it simply raised the question as to what constitutes self-\ndefense. SENATOR VANDENBERG said what was uppermost in his mind\nwas the poignant memory of the hours of debate over the Kellogg-\nBriand Pact on this very question of self-defense. REPRESENTATIVE\nEATON asked if it would be self-defense if we acted when a South\nAmerican country was attacked. MR. BOWMAN explained that para-\ngraph 1, Section C of Chapter VIII provides that a regional agree-\nment would have to have the approval of the Security Council. It\nwould be possible, he said, to write into a particular regional arrange-\nment the whole procedure for action on a regional basis and include\nthere a definition of the meaning of self-defense. MMR. DuJLLES pointed\nout that the members of the -Organization, under paragraph 4, Chap-\nter II, Principles, pledged "to refrain in their international relations\nfrom the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the\npurposes of the Organization." Since the prevention of aggression\nwould be consistent with the purposes of the Organization, action by\na state in self-defense would be in accord with the principles of the\norganization.\n  MR. PAsvoLsKy stated that there was no question as to the right of\na nation to act in self-defense. The question was whether the right\nof self-defense included action on a regional basis. He pointed out\nthat the Act of Chapultepec, which was not yet binding on a long-\nterm basis, did not really meet this question. In the conclusion of the\ntreaty provided for in the Act of Chapultepec, however, the question\nwould arise, and if we intend to extend the right of self-defense to act\nunder this treaty, we would have to write into the treaty the proposi-\ntion that an attack on any American state is an attack on all the Ameri-\ncan states.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG stated that, if he was asked on the floor of\nthe Senate whether, under the Charter, states still had the right of\nself-defense, was the only thing he could say that the right was\nimplicit? Mt. BOWMAN pointed out that the document did not give\nany assurance on this matter. MR. PAsvorsKY stated that we were\nprotected by the veto power on any question concerning the consis-\ntency of a regional arrangement with the General Organization. The\nCouncil would have to say that our regional arrangement was incon-\nsistent. On this question we would have a veto power. Of course\nwe should recognize, he added, that the Soviet Union had this same\npower.\n  MW. STASSEN stated that the existence of a Security Council should\nnot mean that we develop a weak and vacillating policy.
