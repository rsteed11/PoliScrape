General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 669\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nnot desirable to include the Act since it was a transient instrument.\nTo this MR. HAcKWORTH said that the Act has two parts, one of which\nrelates to the war period and ends with it and the other to the post-\nwar in which the implementation of the Act is contemplated through\nthe negotiation of a treaty. SENATOR CONNALLY thought there was\nmerit in the mention of the Act in so far as it might constitute a\nwarning to other states to keep out of this hemisphere and in so far\nps it might give body and content to the vague concept of self-defense.\nTEE CHAIR inquired whether it. might not be desirable to mention the\nMonroe Doctrine and SENATOR VANDENBERG thought that such a ref-\nerence was outdated-that we had gone beyond the point where we\ncould speak exclusively of the Monroe Doctrine.. MR. GoIGa-called\nattention to the fact that mention of the Monroe Doctrine in Article\nXXII [XXI] in the League Covenant had always proved rather\nembarrassing at Geneva; that it was very difficult to explain to non-\nAmerican states precisely what was meant by the Monroe Doctrine.\n  THE CHAIR at this point canvassed the opinion of the meeting and\nit was agreed that the new draft should be discussed with the other\nsponsoring governments.\n  MR. BOWMAN said that there appeared to be consensus that the\ndraft represented our maximum demands. He thought this should be\nmade clear to Mr. Eden so that he would have the assurance that later\non we would not ask for more. TIE CHAIRMAN again said that in the\ndiscussions he would stress that we had built on the French- amend-\nment and would discuss the draft in general terms, since the specific\ntext had not yet been cleared by the War and Navy Departments or\napproved by the President. MR. DUNN thought it desirable not to\nsay that the new draft was a modification of the French amendment\nbut rather that it was based on the French position. SENATOR CON-\nNALLY thought that the Delegation must come to a definite conclusion\nand stand by it in the discussions with the other powers.- Hie said\nthat it might be well to emulate Stalin's tactics at Yalta, where he had\ntold Churchill and Roosevelt that he could not vary from the position\nhe had taken; that it was the sine qua non of Russian approval of the\nYalta conclusions. THE CHAIR agreed that a firm position should be\ntaken but thought it should be with respect to the fundamental ideas\ncontained in the draft and not on the exact text.\n  ME. Roca u       said that the draft under consideration repre-\nsented our minimum demands, not the maximum, as Mr. Bowman had\nindicated. MR. BOWMAN replied that he had reference solely to the\nfact that Eden is about to leave and the Secretary must take a posi-\ntion and inform Eden that he can leave with the assurance that his\ndeputies will not be called upon to make greater concessions later on.\nCOmmANDER STASSEN thought that the draft represented both the mini-\nmum and the maximum.\n669\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0731&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0731&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0731&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0731&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0731&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0731&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0731&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0730&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0732&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0730&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0732&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0731&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
