We have explained to him\nthat we do not see how a private organization, or for that matter any\norganization, could have a status of adviser to a conference and we\npointed out to him that even international organizations like the\nILO " and the League of Nations, which are directly interested in\nthe formation of the United Nations Organization, are not being in-\nvited to participate and will have no official status. We suggested\nthat the views of his group could be gotten before the Conference\nif he would submit them to the Secretary General of the Conference\nwith the request that they be distributed to the participating delega-\ntions.

See Minutes of third meeting of the Informal Organizing Group,\nApril 13, p. 283.\n  " As the Soviets were not represented in the International Labor Organization,\nIt was assumed that for that reason alone they would oppose ILO participation\nand would prefer WTUC representation. In telegram 841 of March 21, the\nAmbassador in the Soviet Union (Harriman) cited a statement which was the\nfirst indication the Embassy had noted concerning official attitude of the\nSoviet\nGovernment on this subject to the effect that the Government was favorably\ndis-\nposed toward proposal that trade union representatives participate in the\nCon-\nference with !advisory vote (500.00/3-2145).\nWilliam Green and George Meany, President and Secretary-Treasurer, re-\nspectively, of the American Federation of Labor.\n2In a memorandum of April 11 President Roosevelt indicated his approval of\nthe Secretary\'s message (500.00/4-1145).\n  3Transmitted by the White House Map Room to President Roosevelt at Warm\nSprings, Ga.\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
