However, in a meeting which the President had\nwith certain members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on\nJanuary 1lth,#* he had bee  said by Mr. Acheson to hlavq gone "fur-\ntlier than expected towards agreement with the Russian view  .19\nof1 requiring unanimity."

He was puzlezd\nby the reference to Chapter VIII, Section C, paragraph 1, and pro-\nceeded to read that paragraph from the Russian text of the IDumbair-\nton Oaks documents which he had in his hands. I told- hiim that what\nwe had in mind was the question of whether or not the Council should\nencourage a regional group or agency to undertake peaceful settle-\nment of a local or regional dispute. He thought that was logical in\nterms of our general formula.\n  He said that he was anxious to have another talk because, on vew\nof his imminent departure for Moscow, it had occurred to him that\nthis would be a good opportunity to clarify his mind on a number of\npoints.\n  1 For a summary of conferences of President Roosevelt with a sub-committee\nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 11, and of Secretar\nStettinius with the Committee as a whole on January 17, see Postwar Foreign\nPolicy Preparqtion, p. 384.\n  9 Omission Indicated in the original.\n  Andrey Andreyevich Gromyko.\n  For memorandum of conversation of January 11, see Conferences at Malta\nand Yalta, p. 68.
