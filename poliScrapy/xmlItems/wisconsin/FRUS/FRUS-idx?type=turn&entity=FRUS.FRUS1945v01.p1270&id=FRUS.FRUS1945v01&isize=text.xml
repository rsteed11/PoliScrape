It had\nbeen presumed by the board that this report was to be submitted to\nCongress by the President and made public. Dr. Bowman wanted\nto know if this was the feeling of the Delegation. MR. DUNN agreed\nwith Dr. Bowman that the report should be prepared in such a way\nthat it might be made public at some future date. THE SECRETARY\ndeclared that he too favored this procedure ...\n  At this point MR. IIACKwoRTH declared that he would have to leave\nand he wanted to report that Committee IV/1 had completed the\nCourt Statute at 12: 30 the previous evening.68\n  SENATOR CONNALLY urged that the Four Power interpretation and\nthe Yalta Formula be made public soon.

DR. BOWMAN declared that his Committee had\ngiven a great deal of thought to just this question. The Committee\nagreed with Commander Stassen that no secret report should be sent\nto the President from the Delegation; however, any member of the\nDelegation, any citizen in fact, could make a secret report to the Presi-\ndent.
