He thought it, was\nplain horse sepse, to keep our decisions to ourselves.\n  T;n SsECRETARY asked how many fundamental changes had actually\nbeen agreed to in the course of the discussions. 1\\I4;. DuuLEs said\nthat he thought there was one, which was the suggestionof Mr. Van-\ndenberg on the revision of treaties. MR. PASVOLSKY thought most\nof the suggestions were by way of clarification and that the one basic\nchange was that of Senator Vandenberg\'s. MR. PASVOLSKY added\nthat, if this proposed change was now announced, he was afraid that\nother nations would interpret it as an attempt to bring pressure on\nthem. He thought it was better to handle the matter subtly and care-\nfully, and that, if it were so handled, it would be possible to secure\nthe addition that Senator Vandenberg favored. SENATOR CONNALLY\nagreed that the opposition to this addition would be hardened if the\nposition of the Delegation was now announced. THE SECRETARY\nthought it would be best at this time to reserve our position.\n  MR. STASSEN asked when it was contemplated that the Russians\nwould be told of this suggestion, since he was sure that Foreign Com-\nmissar Molotov\'s first question would be: "What changes do you pro-\nPOSe?"  MR. PASVOLSKY indicated that we were still going over the\ntentative decisions and discussing proposed changes.\n  THE SECRETARY said he envisaged having the Big Four meet to-\ngether after the general discussion on the opening days, at which time\nwe could bring forward our two or three changes. MR. PASVOLSKY\nthought that, if the matter was handled in this way, we would actually\nfind that we had considerable support for our suggestions.\n  Mn. STAssEN asked if the Russians would give up their three votes\nif we accepted the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. MR. DULLES noted\nthat in fact the Russian proposal was not inconsistent with the Pro-\nposals as they stood at present, since the question raised by the Rus-\nsian proposal was: "What is in fact a state?" If the three republics\nwere considered independent states then they could each be members\nof the General Assembly under the present Proposals. Mn. STASSEN\nsaid he thought most of the suggestions were by way of filling in the\nProposals and interpreting the document, and that they were not\nfundamental. He thought that no release would be better than the\npresent one, and that it might at this time be better to remain silent.\n  THE SECRETARY indicated that at some routine press conference he\nmight say quite informally that the discussions of the Delegation had\nbeen entirely satisfactory and that the Delegation was generally in\nagreement.  SENATOR VANDENBERG questioned the phrase "generally\nin agreement". Did that mean that the Delegation had agreed to\nhis proposal-to what he believed was indispensable if the Senate\nwas going to ratify the treaty?
