General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 456\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\n  SENATOR CONNALLY inquired as to whether it might not be possible\nthat the British Delegation were using the Dominion Delegations in\nthis instance as a "stalking horse". MR. PASVOLSKY said that in\nhis-\nopinion such was not the case; that Mr. Eden had said in the Steering\nCommittee meeting that his original position was the same as that of\nMr. Padilla. MR.- EDEN said that the compromise which he had put\nforth was advanced in the hope -that if he -moved from his original posi-\ntion Mr. Molotov would also move and it might be possible to agree on\na compromise proposal.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY inquired asuto whether there was any possibility\nthat the British Delegation was doublecrossing us; that they were\npetting the Russians at our expense. MR. HARRIMAN replied that he\ndid not believe that such was the case; that the entire affair was due\nentirely to a misunderstanding and because of that fact he believed\nthat it-wQuld be possible for the United States Delegation to straighten\nout this situation. Furthermore, he said that in his opinion, no useful-\npurpose was served in questioning the motivations of the British Dele-\ngation in this particular instance. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said that she\nagreed with this general position of Mr. Harriman. SENATOR CON-\nNALLY said that in his opinion it all developed into an unfortunate\nsituation.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM then inquired as to whether the Delegation\nwould continue to maintain the original United States position in this\nmatter. THE SECRETARY said that both the President and Mr. Hull\nhad advised him to stick to the original position. He also said that\nlhe would like to have the advice of the Delegation in this matter as to\nwhether (a) he should stick to the original position or (b) accept the\nEden proposal.\n  The Delegation was then polled by the Secretary with the following\nresults: DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said that if the Eden compromise satisfied\nthe Soviet Delegation, then the thought it should be acceptable to us.\nIf -it did not, then she thought we should revert to our original position.\nREPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said that he thought we ought to adhere to\nthe original- United States position in this matter, but if the Soviet\nDelegation was willing to accept the Eden, compromise, he thought it\nshould be accepted by us.\n  When he was asked for his views, SENATOR CONNALLY inquired as to\nwhat the wishes of President Truman were. THE SECRETARY replied\nthat the President preferred a single President for the Conference, to\nbe chosen from the United States -Delegation, but that we were\nauthorized to accept the proposal advanced by Mr. Eden.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said that he felt the Secretary had been too\nscrupulous in this matter; that he was, in effect, tying his own hands\ntoo much by asking for detailed instructions from the Delegation.\nHe said that in his opinion the Secretary should be authorized to\n456\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0518&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0518&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0518&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0518&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0518&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0518&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0518&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0517&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0519&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0517&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0519&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0518&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
