General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1242\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nhe declared, -could not be recommended without the support of the\nUnited Kingdom and Mr. Hickerson did not think it would be pos-\nsible to get that support. It was essential, Mr. Hickerson thought,;\nthat the United Kingdom and the United States move together on\nthis issue in view of the fact that they were in joint occupation. The\nUnited States had been trying for some time to influence the British\nto take a more liberal position with respect to Italy because of the\nfact that the present repressive policy would throw the country into,\nthe arms of the Italian Communists. It had been this Government\'s\npolicy to support the existing Italian Government on the grounds\nthat this would save the country from Communism. REPRESENTATIVE.\nBLOOM asked how any proposal to invite Italy to the Conference would\nbe received by Greece and Yugoslavia and some of the other nations\nof Europe. MR. HICKERSON replied that there was no doubt that these\ntwo nations particularly would oppose violently any invitation too\nItaly. THE SECRETARY remarked that if Italy were to be considered\nfor invitation, the question of Albania and Korea and the other\'\nmatters which the Delegation had been trying to avoid might come\nup. MR. HICKERsON agreed with the Secretary\'s position and de--\nclared, for this reason, it would be impossible for the United States\nto support an invitation to Italy. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked how\nthe Delegation could "lay down the torch" at that time in view\nof the\'\nfact that the Italian memorandum had been circulated over Secretary-\nStettinius\' signature. MR. IhICKERSON replied that this had been done\nin the Secretary\'s international capacity as President of the Confer-\nence and for this reason no one "was carrying the torch". MR. HCK-\nERSON declared, however, that the United States could support the\nItalian cause if it wanted to. THE SECRETARY then conducted an\nimaginary conversation which was concluded by the Secretary being\nasked what he had done to follow up on the Italian situation. MR.\nHICKERSON remarked that the Secretary could reply in such an event\nthat he had asked that conversations be held with the sponsoring gov-\nernments with a view to determining their reactions to inviting\nItaly. This, Mr. Hickerson declared, had been done and he did not\nthink that concurrence would be obtained from the other sponsoring-\ngovernments for extending an invitation to Italy. Mr. Hickerson\nobserved that the Secretary would have been in a worse position if\nthe Italians had published their memorandum in Rome, together\nwith a statement that the Secretary had been asked to circulate the\nmemorandum and had not done so. THE SECRETARY declared that he\nwould have called for a meeting of the Executive Committee if he\nhad been there. MR. HICKERSON replied that the Italians had not\nasked for any such thing and had requested only that their paper be\'\ncirculated among the other delegations at San Francisco.
