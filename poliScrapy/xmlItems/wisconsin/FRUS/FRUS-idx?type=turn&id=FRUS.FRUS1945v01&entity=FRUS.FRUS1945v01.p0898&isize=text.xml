It was, therefore, agreed, after\nthe President had been consulted by telephone and had approved, that\nthe Latin-American delegations should be told privately by the Secre-\ntary, as Secretary of State rather than as Chairman of the US dele-\ngation, that it is the intention of the US Government to call a meeting\nof American foreign ministers in Washington in the fall 52 to nego-\ntiate a treaty to implement the Act of Chapultepec.\n  A further meeting with the chiefs of the principal Latin American\ndelegations was held in the afternoon of May 15. The draft of Chap-\nter VIII, Section B, paragraph 12 discussed at this meeting differed\nslightly from that previously presented in that, in order to eliminate\nthe implication that the Security Council might "fail" to maintain\npeace and security, the first sentence of the paragraph had been re-\nvised to read as follows:\n  "Nothing in this charter impairs the inherent right of self-defense,\neither individual or collective, in the event that the Security Council\ndoes not maintain international peace and security and that armed\nattack against a member state occurs."\n  The Latin American representatives were at the same time informed\nof our willingness to make two minor verbal changes referred to above\nand of the proposal for the calling of an Inter-American Conference.\nTheir reception of this program in its totality was excellent and,\nwhile they will still wish to consult a little among themselves, it is\nnow safe to say that this issue at the Conference has been resolved\ninsofar as the Latin Americans are concerned. They asked whether\nthey might immediately convey to their governments the information\nin regard to the Inter-American Conference and were told that they\nmight do so if it were done privately without any public announcement.\n  This step having been successfully accomplished, the program was\nimmediately laid before the representatives of the other members of\nthe Big Five. The reaction of the representatives of Great Britain,\nFrance and China seemed on the whole to be favorable to the program.\nThe Russian reaction has not yet been forthcoming. The matter,\ntherefore, rests at this point.\n  Such satisfactory progress having been made, it is hoped that it\nwill be possible to submit the proposed amendments to the charter\nto the appropriate technical committee of the Conference within the\n52 See vol.
