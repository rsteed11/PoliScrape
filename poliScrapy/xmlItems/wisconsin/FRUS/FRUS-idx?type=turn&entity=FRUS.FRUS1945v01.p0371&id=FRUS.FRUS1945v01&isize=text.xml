General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 309\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nthat might be true but he still insisted on his position, pointing out\nthat a state like Argentina might provide bombs and air force, etc.,\nand then proceed to cause trouble and no action could be taken until\nits forces stepped across a boundary line. MR. ARMSTRONG pointed\nto the murder of Chancellor Dollfuss of Austria in 1934.4\n  MR. DuLLES said that the trouble with international law was that\nit had reserved the right of any state to do as it pleased, although the\nDumbarton Oaks Proposals represented an attempt to break this prin-\nciple down. He wondered whether something might not be gotten\nthrough the Senate. SENATOR VANDENBERG said that a reading of\nthe Senate\'s comments on the advisory opinions of the Permanent\nCourt of International Justice were not reassuring. COMMANDER\nSTASsEN thought the Senate had probably changed its opinions, since\nthe debate on the court, and paid high praise to Senator Vandenberg\'s\nleadership in this respect. SENATOR VANDENBERG stated, however,\nthat this was one of the "fantasies obsessing the Senate". COM-\nMANDER STASSEN said that wars broke out because nations took cover\nunder the concept that their actions fell only within their domestic\njurisdiction.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY was skeptical whether the Senate would ap-\nprove the idea of permitting the Security Council to decide as to\n"domestic jurisdiction". MR. D-uLLES thought it was just a, matter\nof talk in the Security Council in any case. SENATOR CONNALLY\nthought that "talk" would imply responsibility and action. SENATOR\n\'VANDENBERG thought we would be lucky to get by the Senate with the\nreservations in any case, since the Senate had always thought that\nthe United States should decide what was within its "domestic\njurisdiction".\n  SENATOR CONNALLY said that we were covering virgin territory, And\nit would be best to proceed conservatively in order to accomplish any-\nthing at all. There was considerable objection, he thought, and we\nmust allow experience and the passing of the years to develop the\nstructure of peace. What we were now doing was starting, and he\nwanted to lay the foundations for success. MR. ARMSTRONG suggested\nthat paragraph 7 might be modified to give the Security Council au-\nthority to determine whether a question were purely domestic, pointing\nout that we have a veto power in the Security Council, an idea which\nSENATOR VANDENBERG approved.\n   DR. BOWMAN thought we might accomplish something by leaving\n out the reference to international law in paragraph 7, since he believed\n this was restrictive in the sense that international law had developed\n 4Engelbert Dollfuss, Austrian Premier, whose assassination resulted from\nthe\n Nazi coup in Vienna on July 25, 1934.
