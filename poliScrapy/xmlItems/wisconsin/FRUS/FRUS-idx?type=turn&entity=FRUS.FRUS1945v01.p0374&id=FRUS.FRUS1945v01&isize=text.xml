General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 312\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\nPresident Roosevelt, Marshal Stalin, and Prime Minister Churchill.\nIt was agreed there that the powers who had participated in the Dum-\nbarton Oaks conversations and who were sponsoring the United Na-\ntions Conference would meet in preliminary consultations prior to\nthe United Nations Conference on this question. These preliminary\nconsultations have not taken place. Invitations have been sent out\nto the other nations involved, and their representatives are here, but\nthe consultations have not been held because the three Departments,\nArmy, Navy, and State, have not been able to agree on a paper as the\nbasis of discussion with the representatives of the other nations.\n  MRS. STETTiNIuS further announced that the -Secretaries of War and\nNavy and himself had met and had agreed upon a paper on a policy\nstatement for presentation to the President.\n  MR. STETTINIuS pointed out that on the diplomatic side it was felt\nthat we would be in a weak position if we cannot deal with the ques-\ntion of trusteeship in some way at the San Francisco Conference.\nThe Department, he said, is in complete agreement with the Army\nand Navy with respect to the necessity for full protection of our\nsecurity interests, but the Department also appreciates the difficulty\n'in which this country would find itself if it should lay itself open to\nthe charge of expansionist ambitions by pursuing a policy of annexa-\ntion. An annexation policy would be contrary to the policy con-\n-sistently followed by the late President Roosevelt. MR. STETrINIUS\nconcluded by stating that he and the Secretaries of War and Navy\nfelt that they had arrived at an agreeable solution and he asked Sec-\nretary Stimson if he would wish-to make a statement on the subject.\n                STATEMENT BY SECRETARY STIMSON\n  SECRETARY SnMSON stated that the position of the War and Navy\nDepartments has been, and Secretary Forrestal and himself feel\nstrongly, that under no circumstances should anything be done which\nwould prevent the American Government and Delegation from pre-\nsenting a united front at San Francisco. This, said SECRETARY STIM-\nSON, tended to put Secretary Forrestal and himself in a somewhat\ndifficult position. He stated that he knew nothing of the Yalta agree-\nmefnt on trusteeship until the results were made public.\n  SECRETARY STIMSON continued that in the treatment of the question\nof trusteeship it is imperative from- the standpoint of the safety of\nthe United States that there should be an understanding of the differ-\nence between the kind of bases we feel essential to the safety of the\nUnited States in the Pacific and the territories out of which the whole\nsystem of mandates and trusteeship has grown. SECRETARY STIMSON\nexpressed the view that the question of mandates in the last war was\ncompletely different from the question of bases in this war.
