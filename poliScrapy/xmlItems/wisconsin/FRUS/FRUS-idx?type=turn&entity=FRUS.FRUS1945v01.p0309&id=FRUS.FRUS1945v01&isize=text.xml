General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 247\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE2\nprovision,6 which seemed rather significant in view of the fact that\nRussia was the only country that had ever been expelled from the\nLeague of Nations.7  MR. DULLES commented that perhaps the\nU.S.S.R. did not want to be unique. MR. PASVOLSKY said that he did not,\nthink it necessary for the Delegation to agree now on a position with re-\ngard to expulsion. There might be very strong objections to this pro--\nvision in the Conference, and it would be wise to wait and see how\nstrong they were before deciding what position the American Delega-\ntion should take.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY commented that suspension is surely as strong\na measure of enforcement as expulsion, and MR. PASVOLSKY replied\nthat it is actually stronger. He recommended, however, that this\nquestion be left subject to future development.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked whether there should not be a provision\nfor withdrawal from membership. MR. PASVOLSKY said no provision\nhad been made in the Proposals because there was some fear that the\nstatement about withdrawal might give an impression of instability.\nSENATOR CONNALLY said, however, that a state should know before it\njoined the Organization what procedures would be necessary if it\nwanted to get out. MR. PASVOLSKY said it might be useful to discuss\nthis point, although it had not so far been insisted upon by other\ngovernments.\n  THE SECRETARY asked what a government would do if it wanted to\nwithdraw from the Organization. REPRESENTATIVE BLoOM replied\nthat he thought it could denounce the treaty under which it had ac-\ncepted the Charter. SENATOR CONNALLY commented that the Con-\nstitution of the United States had no provision for withdrawal and\nthat when some of the states tried to secede, they had not been per-\nmitted to do so.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG asked whether we could admit that a state\ncan withdraw by deninciation, and MR. PAsvOIsEY replied in the\naffirmative. SENATOR VANDENBERG replied: "Why not say so?" and\nhe asked Senator Connally whether it would not help in the Senate\nto have this clearly stated. SENATOR CONNALLY said he was doubtful\nwhether a signatory to a treaty could denounce it when there was no\nclause in the treaty providing for denunciation.\n   MR. BOWMAN said there were really two questions involved. One\n was what our attitude should be if the matter is brought up in the\n Conference, and the other is what points the American Delegation\n should insist upon having included in the Charter.\n 6 See progress reports on the Dumbarton Oaks Conversations, August 25, 1944,\n section (d), and September 7, 1944, section (c), Foreign Relationsf, 1944,\nvol.
