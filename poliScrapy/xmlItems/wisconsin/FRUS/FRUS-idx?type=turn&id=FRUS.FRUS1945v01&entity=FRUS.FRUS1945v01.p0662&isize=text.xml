PASVOLSKY said that this paragraph was now approved by the\nUnited States, British and Chinese Delegations, and had been agreed\nto in principle by the Soviet Delegation, although the latter wanted\ntime to study it further. MR. MoLoTov said that he would give an\nanswer as to their position in this matter later in the day.\n                    REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\n  MR. PASVOLSKY reported that with respect to the proposed amend-\nments affecting regional arrangements, the discussion had not been\ncompleted but that they would meet later in the day at a time to be\nagreed to by the four Foreign Ministers, to continue their consultations.\n           AMENDMENTS DEFERRED FOR FURTHER STUDY\n  THE SECRETARY then said that they would move to the consideration\nof other items which had been deferred the previous evening for\nfurther study.\n1. Chapter VIII, Section A, Paragraph 4\n  The first of these, MR. STETTINIUS explained, concerned the pro-\nposed amendment to Chapter VIII, Section A, paragraph 4. He said\nthat he was now prepared to announce that the United States Delega-\ntion, which had previously been the only one disagreeing, would ac-\ncept the British proposal to add the following sentence to this para-\ngraph: "If the Security Council deems that the continuance of the\nparticular dispute is in fact likely to endanger the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, it shall decide whether to take action\nunder paragraph 5 or whether itself to recommend such terms of\nsettlement as it may consider appropriate.""\n  MR. EDEN said that he was happy to learn that this had been ac-\ncepted, and because of its acceptance consequential amendments would\nbe required in Chapter VIII, Section B, paragraph 1. Accordingly,\nSIR WILLIAM MALKIN explained that a legal question was involved as\nto whether the Security Council in taking measures under Section B,\nparagraph 1, would take them following its recommendations under\neither paragraph 4 or 5, of Section A. Accordingly, he suggested,\nto clarify the situation, that Section B, paragraph 1, should be\namended to make clear that both paragraphs 4 and 5 of Section A\nwere included, the sentence as reworded being as follows: "Should\nthe Security Council deem that a failure to settle a dispute in accord-\nance with procedures indicated in paragraph 3 of Section A or in\naccordance with its recommendations made under paragraphs 4 or 5\nof Section A constitutes a threat to the maintenance of international\npeace and security, it should take any measures necessary for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security in accordance with\nthe purposes and principles of the organization."\n600\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
