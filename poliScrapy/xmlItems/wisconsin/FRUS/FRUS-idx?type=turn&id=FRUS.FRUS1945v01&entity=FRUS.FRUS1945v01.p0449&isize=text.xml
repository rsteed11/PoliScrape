General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 387\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nSecretary reported that he would like to read Mr. Truman\'s letter,\naddressed to him, to the Delegation.94  The President directed that\nwe support the proposal for admission to membership in the Organi-\nzation of the Ukraine and the White Russian Republics. The Secre-\ntary then read the letter to the Delegation.\n  The Secretary reported that the President was only thinking of\nseats in the Assembly for the two Republics after the Organization\nwas established. Mr. Bohlen said this was correct and that the admis-\nsion of the White Russian Republic and the Ukrainian Republic to\nrepresentation at the Conference was left open. Senator Vandenberg\nthought this open question would certainly be raised by the Russians.\nMr. Bohlen agreed since it was logical he said, if the Republics\nwere admitted as initial members, that representation would be asked\nfor them at the Conference. This however, Mr. Bohlen said, was a\nsecond phase of the problem and that for the time being Mr. Molotov\nwas dealing with the first phase of the question.\n  The Secretary stated that the question at issue was whether the two\nSoviet Republics would have seats in the General Assembly after\nthe establishment of the Organization. With that introduction he\nsaid he would ask Mr. Dunn to make his recommendation for action\non this question. Mr. Dunn replied that he would like first to refer\nto the terms of the Yalta Agreement on this question.95 By this\nAgreement it was pledged that when the Conference was held a Soviet\nproposal would be supported to admit to original membership in the\nOrganization the two Soviet Republics. Mr. Dunn said his thought\nwas that at Yalta there had been several agreements regarding the\nnew Provisional Government of Poland, the liberated areas, trustee-\nship questions, and that among these was the agreement on the admis-\nsion of the two Soviet Republics.96 All of these agreements he said\nhad been made public. The question of timing arose only in connec-\ntion with this one agreement on the admission of the Republics since\nthat agreement began "when the Conference is held  .". Mr. Dunn\nsaid we would have to face the fact that the Conference is now being\nheld and that this question would come up at the first business session.\nThe Polish question was in a state of consultation and development and\nwas not up for final decision or conclusion at this time. However,\nthe problem of admission of the two Republics was before us and Mr.\nDunn felt that unless we followed through and went along in full\ngood faith to do all we could to assure the admission of the two Re-\npublics our position with respect to the other agreements reached at\nYalta would be very weak.\n   For letter of April 22, see Department of State Bulletin, April 29, 1945,\np. 80.\n 95 See Protocol of Proceedings of the Crimea Conference, February 11, 1945,\n Conferences at Malta and Yalta, p. 976.\n 9 For the various agreements, see the Communique and Protocol of Proceed-\nings of the Conference, ibid., pp. 968-982.\n387\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
