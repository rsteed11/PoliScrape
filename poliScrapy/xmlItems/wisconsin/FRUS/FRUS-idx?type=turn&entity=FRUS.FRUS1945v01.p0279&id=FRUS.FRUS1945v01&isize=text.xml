It was generally agreed that he should say that\nthe Delegation would vote by simple majority vote.\n  ,[Here follows discussion on the list of advisers and unofficial repre-\nsentatives of national organizations.63]\n   DIscussIoN OF PROPOSALS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION\n   THE SEcRETARY asked Mr. Pasvolsky to, open the discussion of Pro-\nposals and Suggestions for Consideration, Book 2.64 MiR. PASVOLS:KY\nsaid that Book 3 contained a comprehensive analysis of the views of\nthe other governments and of private groups on the Dumbarton Oaks\nProposals, whereas Book 2 summarized this material and brought\nforward certain definite suggestions. He said that the members of\nthe Delegation would be assigned to special committees which would\nwork on certain portions of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, and that\nthese committees would have before them, in addition to the text of\nthe Proposals, statements of changes suggested for discussion by the\nvariQus delegations. Each committee, he said, would then work on\na particular part of the Proposals and the drafting would be done\nlargely by subcommittees.\n  From our point of view, he continued, there were two things to\nconsider: (1) What amendments we ourselves would wish to offer to\nthe Proposals and to. have included mi the basic documentation of the\ncommittees of the Conference; and (2) What our attitude was to be\nwith respect to the various proposals brought forward by other gov-\nernments, since it was almost inevitable that a great number of pro-\nposals would be presented. He added that it still had to be deter-\nruined how much consultation there would be between the Sponsor-\ning Governments on the suggestions that they would make. In any\ncase, however, it was necessary to go through the Proposals discussing\nthem from these two points of view, so that it would be possible for\nthe staff to draft its text for a charter on the basis of the agreements\nreached. We would then go to the Conference with a document in\nthe form of a charter.\n  For the moment, MR. PASVOLSKY said, we should concern ourselves\nodly with the basic ideas and not bother about the language. A dis-\ncussion of the language, he said, would occur in considering the actual\ndraft charter.\n  " For list of organizations, see press release of April 10, Department\nof State\nBulletin, April 15, 1945, p. 671.
