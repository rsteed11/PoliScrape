General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 677\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nthat the regional arrangement only operated in self-defense. The in-\ntent was to bring the Security Council right into the picture.\n  MR. ARMSTRONG commented that the new wording emphasized the\nSecurity Council more than did the former text.\n  THE SECRETARY suggested that Mr. Pasvolsky might discuss the\nFrench amendment which the British prefer to the American wording.\n              FAILURE OF SECURITY COUNCIL TO ACT\n  MR. PASVOLSKY pointed out that if the Security Council fails to agree\non an act, then the member state reserves the right to act for the main-\ntenance of peace, justice, etc. The League of Nations Covenant, he\nsaid, had a provision that if the Council fails to act, then a member\nstate resumes freedom of action for the maintenance of peace.  The\npresent French amendment is much like that except that it says "after\nthe Council fails to agree". The freedom of action reserved to the\nmember state if the Council fails to agree, is much greater than in the\nAmerican wording-a reservation for individual freedom of action.\nMr. Eden\'s interpretation of this is that group action is not precluded\nand is therefore entirely possible. There is agreement that the French\nwording permits much more freedom of action than the American,\nbut the British were shocked by the American concept of self-defense.\nIt was to them a new thought that self-defense can operate outside of\na nation\'s territorial limits. The wording of -the French text was as\nfollows: "Should the Council not succeed in reaching a decision the\nmembers of the organization reserve to themselves the right to act\nas they may consider necessary in the interest of peace, right and\njustice".\n  COMMANDER STASSEN suggested a new wording of the US Gen 93\nas follows: "if the-Scurity Council does not prevent aggression and\naggression occurs by any state against any member state . . .\n  [Mr. Rockefeller arrived at this point and the Chairman.brought.\nhim up to date on the discussion, including the Army and Navy re-\naiction to the proposed wording on regional arrangements, and the fear\nthat it would strengthen the hemispheric situation at the expense of\nthe world situation.] 74\n                        MR. HELL\'s VIEWS\n  THE SECRETARY expressed regret that he had not been seeing the\nLatin \'American Foreign Ministers. He announced that he had heard\nfrom Mr. Hull this morning, and that Mr. Hullpelt that the American.\nposition was veering- away from a -strong international organization,\nMR. AULL felt that the proposed. iew wording on regional arrange-\nments would impair thef strength odlhe international organization.
