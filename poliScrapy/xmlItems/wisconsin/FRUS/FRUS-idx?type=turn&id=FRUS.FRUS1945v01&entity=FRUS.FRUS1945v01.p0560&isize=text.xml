FAHY stated that he did not feel strongly on this matter, as he\ndid not think it was a critical point. He suggested renaming the\ncourt and starting anew. He noted that therevised draft statute\nretained about 99 peri cent of the Statute of the present Court, so that\nit had the benefit of the experience of the Court. He suggested that\nit be called "The International Court of Justice", as stated in\nthe\nDumbarton Oaks Proposals.\n  M. DULLES noted that the American Bar Association was unani-\nmously in favor of continuing the present Court. He felt that the\nDelegation ought to follow the line strongly supported by the Ameri-\ncan Bar Association. COMMANDER STASSEN observed that the juris-\ndiction of the old Court could be carried forward by a clause in the\nCharter in which the United Nations could accept a substitution of a\nnew court.\n  REPRESENTATIvE BLOOMI asked if actually only the name of the court\nwere being changed, since it was stated that 99 per cent of the present\nStatute would be taken over. MR. FAuiY observed that a new court.\nwould really be created, if this statute were adopted. He observed\nthat he did not think that Russia would join the present Court.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEvE asked what Russia\'s attitude was on the Court.\nMR. HACKWORTI said he thought that Russia had no strong feeling one\nway or another, and would go along with a strong movement in either\ndirection. REPRESENTATIVE BLoox-stated that the Delegation must\nconsider what it can get most easily from Congress, whether a. new or\nan old court. It was important to avoid any controversy in Congress\non the matter of the court. MR. HACKWORTH asked if it would be\neasier to get a new court through the Senate than an old one. REP-\nRESENTATIVE BLOOM observed that the House of Representatives would\nhave to be considered as well as the Senate. REPRESENTATIVE EATON\nsaid that it was important to -consider the House because if the House\nhad a strong feeling about a matter, the reaction would be felt in the\nSenate; and that moreover the House, as the voice of the people, could\nback up the Senate. AR. JESsUP noted that the House of Representa-\ntives had first, passed a resolution in favor of a world court.93\n  At this point, the meeting was adjourned.\n  "93For resolution approved by the House of Representatives, March\n3, 1925,\nsee the Congressional Record, vol. 66, pt. 5, pp. 5404 and 5413..
