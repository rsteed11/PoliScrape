STETTINIUS said that he wished to emphasize the informal and\npreliminary character of this consultation among the five powers.\nHe was greatly encouraged and felt that since the group convened\nat 2: 30 good headway had been made. At this point he read the\ndraft which had been handed to him by Mr. Dulles proposing the\nincorporation in Chapter VIII, Section C, Paragraph 1 of the phrase\n"or collective arrangements like that contemplated by the Act of\nChapultepec".\n  MR. DULLES reminded the group that the United States and nine-\nteen other American Republics had joined in signing the Act of\nChapultepec. In the draft presented by the United States we had\nreferred definitely to action like that in the Act of Chapultepec. We\nmust include the Act of Chapultepec somewhere in the draft. This\nhe thought was a possible place.\n  MR. EDEN expressed appreciation to his colleagues for giving atten-\ntion to the draft which had been so hastily prepared and which he\nhad submitted. It would not be possible to resolve this question at\nthe moment but he said that he thought this represented a step in the\nright direction. He thought that perhaps better progress might be\nmade without him. The group unanimously took exception to this\nstatement by Mr. Eden. MR. STETTINIIS suggested that this matter\nbe taken up again on Monday.93 He expressed deep appreciation to\nMr. Eden for his support and expressed deep regret at his prospec-\ntive departure.\nRSC Lot 60-D 224, Box 96: U.S. Min.
