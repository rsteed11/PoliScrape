He hoped that they could accept Senator Vanden-\nberg's proposal.\n  MR. STErNius remarked that we were in no position as yet to go\nforward with a Committee meeting at 10: 30. SENATOR VANDENBERG\nagreed and both remarked that it was necessary to get the Latin\nAmericans together quickly.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY remarked that if we make a unilateral declara-\ntion it will not be binding but will rest only on our own strong right\narm. SENATOR VANDENBERG said we must stall today, since we cannot\ngo ahead with other big four proposals until this is settled even\nthough the Soviets approved. SENATOR CONNALLY said that the big\nquestion was: Would.. the Latin Americans accept this solution?\nSENATOR VANDENBERG inquired just exactly where we stood with the\nLatin Americans; he pointed out that the new language of VIII, B, 12\nclearly removes the veto. Would the Latin Americans be satisfied?\nMR. HACKWORTH commented that he thought they would be if the\nUS. makes it clear that they feel this language clearly covers the\nmatter. AM. STEmNIus said he felt they ought to take it.\n  Mu. ARMSTRONG asked why it was necessary to tell the Latin Amer-\nicans that we intend to make a reservation on this matter and Cox-\nMANDER STAssEN replied that we can certainly tell them that in our\nopinion this covers the Act of Chapultepec.\n  MR. GATES posed a question as to our freedom under this provision\nin case a fleet had started from abroad against an American repub-\nlic, but had not yet attacked. To this COMMANDER STAssEN replied\nthat we could not under this provision attack the fleet but we could\nsend a fleet of our own and be ready in case an attack came.\n  MR. ARMSTRONG inquired what difference there was between our\ntext and the Eden draft which makes Mr. Eden like the latter better.\nSENATOR VANDENBERG replied that the Eden draft would cover the\nright to take action in support of another country; for example the\nU.K. could support Turkey if she should be attacked by Bulgaria.\nSENATOR CONNALLY and Mu. DULLES explained that Mr. Eden's mo-\ntives were (1) a desire to avoid referring to regional agencies which\nwould be dangerously limiting, and (2) also to leave leeway for other\nregional organizations. Mu. ARMSTRONG inquired whether this then\nmeant that we were pushing the U.K. into a stronger position and Mu.\nBOWMAN replied that that was so only if an armed attack had\noccurred.\n  In reply to SENATOR VANDENBERG'S inquiry as to the French reac-\ntion, MR. DUNN said that M. Bidault had liked it and would abandon\nhis insistence on his position.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said that it was important to see some of the\nLatin Americans before talking to the other three sponsoring powers\nand France again. These Latin Americans should include the Co-\n709\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0771&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0771&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0771&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0771&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0771&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0771&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0771&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0770&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0772&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0770&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0772&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0771&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
