DUNN also reported that there was clearly great sentiment for\nthe Eden proposal.\n  MESSRS. DUNN and PASVOLSKY then both reported the happenings\nat the Steering Committee meeting during which it developed that\nMr. Molotov appeared to favor the first part of Mr. Eden\'s proposal\nfor the four Presidents of the Conference, but did not appear to favor\nthe second part of the proposal, whereby the Secretary of State would\npreside at the Steering and Executive Committees. It was clear,\nhowever, that Mr. Molotov had agreed that the Secretary should be\nchairman of the four Presidents. Further, it developed that Mr.\nMolotov had also proposed that there be four chairmen who would\nserve in rotation as heads of the Steering and Executive Committees.\n  MR. DUNN reported that a vote had been taken on the issue but that\nit was not a clear-cut one. In the confusion, Mr. Molotov had made\nhis point that he wanted the vote divided into two parts to cover\nthe two items of the Eden proposal, but Mr. Eden would not consent\nto such a division, although Mr. Fraser of New Zealand had indicated\nhis willingness.

He said that he had told\nthem that the United States Delegation felt that they had been "let\ndown" by the British Delegation. MR. HARRIMAN said that Mr. Eden\ntold him that they had understood that the United States Delegation\nhad accepted the British proposal made the previous evening, stressing\nparticularly that Sir Alexander Cadogan said he so understood from\nhis conversation with Mr. Dunn. MR. HARRIMAN also reported that\nMr. Eden said it was his understanding that Mr. Molotov did not\naccept the British resolution made in the Steering Committee meet-\ning that afternoon, but accepted only that part of the proposal cover-\ning the four Presidents for the Conference. MR. HARRIMAN said\nhe reported to them that the Secretary had talked with the President\nand that the President had insisted that the host Government have the\npresiding officer for the Conference.
