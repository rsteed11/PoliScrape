I think it is important that you meet with the Delegation on Mon-\nday or Tuesday of next week.\n  4. I attach a copy of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals hereto.41 If\nyou wish to review them in detail I would be glad to meet with you\nwith several of our technical experts.\n  5. Presidency-We are having some difficulty with the Soviet Union\nas to the Presidency of the Conference. They have proposed that the\nHeads of the Delegations of the four sponsoring Governmenits should\nbe co-chairmen with rotation in office. Our position, which Presi-\ndent Roosevelt had instructed us to maintain, is that this is cumber-\nsome, impractical and unrealistic. We also feel that if we yield to\nthe Soviet position it might set an undesirable precedent for future\nConferences and even for the, organization itself. Our position is\nthat there should be a single President for the Conference and that\nthe other sponsoring powers would hold the positions of Vice Presi-\ndents and would preside in rotation in the President\'s absence.\n  6. Trusteeships-Another important open question relates to ter-\nritoria-l trusteeships. It was agreed at Yalta, that there should be\ndiscussion among the five proposed permanent members of the Secu-\nrity Council (United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, China\nand France) prior to San Francisco as to the, machinery and prin-\nciples of a trusteeship system to replace the League of Nations mandate\nsystem, and that machinery to create such a system should be made\na part of the Charter of the International Organization. It was also\nagreed that there should be no discussion prior to or at San Fran-\ncis-co of specific territories to be placed under the system, this subject\nbeing left for later agreement.\n  Because of the importance of certain strategic areas in the Pacific\nto our future security a question has arisen as to the wisdom of dis-\ncussing the subject at all at this time. This matter was referred to\nPresident Roosevelt a few days ago with the recommendation that\nhe review the matter with the Secretaries of War, Navy and me on\nhis return. He had agreed to do this on the 19th.\n  President Roosevelt has had the trusteeship system importantly in\nmind for some time and his latest thought on it is evidenced by his\nlast Press Conference in which he specifically stated that "the United\nStates and the other United Nations must accept trusteeships over\nJapanese mandate islands, build new naval and air bases and help\nthe Philippines rebuild, economically, after the Commonwealth be-\ncomes a self-governing nation."
