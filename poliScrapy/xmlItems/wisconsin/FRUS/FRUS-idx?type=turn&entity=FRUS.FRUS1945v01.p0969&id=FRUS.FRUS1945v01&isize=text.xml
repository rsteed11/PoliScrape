VANDENBERG replied that our respect for a treaty should connue\nunless it were changed under the terms of they treaty.\n  MR. PAsVOLSKY stated that the United States could not take an\nindependent position on this matter unless it first consulted with the\nother members of the Big Five. After considerable debate,the Freich\nhad agreed to withdraw from their original position and had agreed\nthat the proposals should be incorporated in the Preable. MR.\nRocR  nmn i declared that the proposal had originatedrwith Chile\nand Colombia,\'8 but added that all the South American states seemed\nto be in favor of it.\nMIR. Nowre declared that the two-thirds.vote requirement was the\ncause of our difficulty and that this would need adjustment soon. ML.\nPAsVOLSKY agreed that the South American countries had adopted an\nobstructionist position-but not on this issue. He declared that there\nhad been disagreement among the Latin American countries-on this\nquestion in Washington before the Conference started.-\n  MR. RocxuEFEu= asked where the Delegation- would stand- on a\nmatter which was related, namely, the introduction of wording in\nChapter V,rto bind the General Assembly to adhere to the principles\nof the Organization established in Chapters I -and II.\n  MN. PAsvOLSKY asked whether these amendments had been definitely\nproposed as amendments, or whether they were merely in the specular\ntive stage. If they had not been proposed definitely, he was of the\nopinion that this should be done before consideration be givento them.\nMI. ROCKEEL      answered that there was no point in proposing\namendments if the United States Delegation was going to oppose\nthem. SECRETARY St\'ErlNIus asked whether the Delegation would\nbe satisfied with incorporating this proposal in the Preamble, but\nDEAN GnDERsuEVE remarked that she did not believe we could hold\nthat position. REPRESENTATVE BLoOM thought that the only place\nfor this proposal was in the Preamble. SENATOR VANDEMBERG re-\nmarked that he would favor the incorporation of the proposal in the\nPrinciples, but would accept the Preamble. RPRESENTATI \'-EATON\nsaid that he favored the Preamble, while COMMANDER STASSEN said that\neither was acceptable to him.\n  MR. NoTrm  expressed the view that the United States was being\nvictimized because of the two-thirds rule, but MR. RoacnJim said\nthat that was not the case because the United. States had not taken\na position.
