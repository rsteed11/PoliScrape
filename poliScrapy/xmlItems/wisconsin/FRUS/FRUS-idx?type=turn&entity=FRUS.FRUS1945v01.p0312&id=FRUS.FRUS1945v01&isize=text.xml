Undoubtedly,\nthe middle states would bring up some proposals along this line.\n  THE SECRETARY remarked that the American Delegation should\nknow what position to take toward the Australian proposal.8 MR.\nPASVOLSKY believed that the decision should be not to bind the General\nAssembly ahead of time but to leave it to that body to decide how to\nchoose the non-permanent members of the Security Council. However,\nif pressure develops in the Conference, he believed it would be possible\nto agree on several criteria, which the General Assembly might apply\nin making its choices.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said he would like to be able to get in a require-\nment for adequate regional representation, but he did not know quite\nhow it should be done.\n  Paragraph 5.-TEE SECRETARY asked Mr. Pasvolsky. to take up\nParagraph 5. MR. PASVOLSKY read the alternative proposal which\nhad been made by Norway 9 [add to the statement on budgetary and\nfinancial powers the provision that the voting rights of states that\ndo not pay their contributions to the expenses of the organization may\nbe suspended]. He said that we should not make any recommenda-\ntion on this point because it was a very ticklish question.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY remarked that under the presexitatext, giving\nthe General Assembly the power to apportion the expenses among the\nmembers, that body would be free to make quite inequitable assess-\nments, and it might possibly make the permanent members pay most\nof the expenses. MAR. PASvOLSKY replied that a scale of contributions\nwould certainly be established and that it could be done either at the\nConference if pressure had developed there for it, or by the Assembly\nitself. MR. GERIG reminded the group that the League of Nations\nhad apportioned expenses according to an established scale. SENATOR\nCONNALLY thought that this was not an insuperable difficulty.\n  Tm: SECRETARY suggested expanding the statement somewhat. MR.\nDaums pointed out that it should be made clear that the apportion-\nment of expenses would not be an arbitrary matter.\n  THE SECRETARY said that we might need a statement of the principle\non which the expenses would be apportioned. MR. BOWMAN suggested\nthe phrase "on an agreed principle". SENATOR VANDENBERG suggested\ninserting "pro-ration". It was agreed that the text should be re-\nphrased to read: "The General Assembly should apportion the ex-\npenses among the members of the Organization according to an agreed\npro-ration."\n  Paragraph 6.-THE SECRETARY asked Mr. Pasvolsky to present\nParagraph 6.
