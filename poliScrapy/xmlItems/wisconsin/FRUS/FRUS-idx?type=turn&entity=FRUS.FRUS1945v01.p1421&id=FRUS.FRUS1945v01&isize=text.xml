General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1359\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nbe construed by the press as indicating a favorable attitude toward\nFranco. REPRPSENTATIVE BLOOM remarked that such a move by this\nGovernment could be construed only as a reliance on the established\nrules of procedure. THE SECRETARY declared that before the Dele-\ngation could take any action on this matter it would be necessary to\nsee a copy of the resolution which the Mexicans were going to present.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER observed that the question represented a deli-\ncate situation. Mr. Padilla was under great pressure from his own\nGovernment to introduce a measure on the question of Spanish par-\nticipation. However, despite what Mr. Hickerson had said, the Mexi-\ncans did not intend to introduce a resolution. The plan was that Mr.\nQuintanilla was to make a brief declaration stating his Government's\nposition on the question of Franco Spain participating in the United\nNations Organization. If there should be any discussion on, or op-\nposition to, this declaration, Mr. Quintanilla was prepared to make\na speech supporting his position. MR. ROCKEFELER expressed the\nopinion that the question might finally take the form of a resolution\npresented by some other Government. SECRETARY STEmNus asked\nwhy the Mexicans would not be satisfied by merely making a speech\nin the Commission session.2  MR. PAsvoLsKY observed that the rules\nof procedure provided that no resolutions could be considered by the\nConference. However, MR. Dutms pointed to the fact that the Con-\nference had adopted a resolution expressing the hope that Poland\nwould soon be represented in the deliberations of the United Nations.22\nMR. HACKWORTH added that Committee IV/1 had also passed a\nresolution.23\n  MR. DUNN observed that the United States could not afford to be\non the wrong side on this matter. He suggested that the Delegation\nshould go along with a resolution or declaration presented by the\nMexicans. MR. Duims pointed out, however, that the Delegation\ndid not have to go along with a violation of the rules of the Confer-\nence. He suggested that a statement should be made that the Mexican\nproposal was consistent with the beliefs of the Delegation, but that\nthe Delegation could vote for the proposal only if it were the proper\nbusiness of the Conference. He held the view that it should be made\nclear that -if the Conference decides that it could properly entertain\nsuch a proposal, the United States would vote in favor of it. MR.\nROC:KEFELLER reiterated that no resolution would be offered but that\nthe Mexicans would make a brief -declaration. However, MR. HIICKER-\nSON remarked that the Greek Delegation had asked him how to vote\n21Doe. 1167, I/10, June 23, UNCIO Documents, vol. 6, p. 124.\n  2 Doe. 30, DC/5 (1), April 27, ibid., vol. 5, p. 96; Doe. 32, DC/7, April\n27, ibid.,\np. 118; and Doe. 20, P/6, April 28, ibid., Vol. 1, p. 168.\n  23Dec. 913, IV/1/74(1), June 12, ibid., vol. 13, p. 392, and Doe. 870,\nIV/1/73,\nJune 9, ibid., p. 413.\n1359\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1421&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1421&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1421&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1421&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1421&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1421&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1421&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1420&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1422&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1420&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1422&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1421&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
