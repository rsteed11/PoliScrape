General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 955\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nwould adhere to the Declaration158 One of the first acts of the new\nDanish Government was to declare that tIhe letter to Churchill and\nRoosevelt was a valid adherence to the United Nations Declaration,\nsuch adherence being retroactive to January 2, 1942.\n      SECRETARY STETTNIUIS thought that the Delegation was in-\ndulging in a lot of unnecessary talk because it would be impossible, in\nany event, to stop the Norwegians from acting. THE SECRETARY\nasked the Delegation for instructions on how to act. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN moved that the United States should vote in favor in the\nSteering Committee of an invitation being tendered to the Danish\nto come to the Conference. REPRESENTATIVE EATON seconded the\nmotion, and- it was carried unanimously.\n                         TIME SCHEDULE\n  THE SECRETARY declared that he should like to consider for a few\nmoments the question of the time schedule for the rest of the\nConference.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY indicated that he wanted to speak for the Coordi-\nnating Committee, of which he was Chairman. That Committee,\nhe stated, would need at least a week after the other Committees\nhad finished their work. There were, MR. PAsvoLsKY pointed out,\none hundred articles, each of which would have to be gone over to\nmake sure that it was consistent with the rest of the Charter. Then\nhe thought that each article would have to go back to the technical\ncommittees for their approval. THE SECRETARY observed that such\na procedure could not possibly be adopted, because it would take far\ntoo much time, and MR. DULLES concurred. MR. PASVOLSKY declared\nthat if this step were to be avoided, the Coordinating Committee must\nget authority from theSteering Committee to make the final decision\non the various articles.\n  . . . THE SECRETARY inquired whether there was any objection to\nhis holding a short meeting with the Heads of the Delegations to ex-\npress his disappointment at the slow tempo with which the Confer-\nence had been progressing. COMMANDER STASSEN declared that the\nanswer given to the Secretary would be that the big powers were hold-\ning up progress. MR. HIcmiBRsON pointed out that Senator Connal-\nly's committee on security problems was one of the slowest, but that\nit was almost finished with its work and was being held up only by\nthe necessity for Big Five confirmation of agreements reached.
