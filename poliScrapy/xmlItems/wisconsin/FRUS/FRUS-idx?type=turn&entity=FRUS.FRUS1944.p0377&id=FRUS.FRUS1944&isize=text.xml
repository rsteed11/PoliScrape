Would it not be equally possible to by-pass\nSingapore by seizing an area to the north or east of it, for example,\nBangkok? Singapore may be very strong and he was opposed to going\nup against strong positions.\n  THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the seizure of localities such\nas Penang and the Kra Isthmus or Moulmein should be studied. As\nfar as Singapore was concerned he did not favor the by-passing\nmethod. There would undoubtedly be a large force of Japanese in the\nMalay Peninsula and it would help the American operations in the\nPacific if we could bring these forces to action and destroy them in\naddition to achieving the great prize of the recapture of Singapore.\nIf Formosa were captured, would the Japanese garrisons to the South\nbe completely cut off'\n  AD1MIRAL KING, replied that these garrisons would be strangulated\nand moust ultimately perish.\n  Tnn: PRIME MINISTER said that all these projects were being ex-\namined and would be put in order. No decision couldci be taken until\nafter Rangoon had been captured. It should not be overlooked that\nAMarshal Stalin had volunteered a solemn undertaking at Teheran\nthat Russia would enter the war against Japan the day that Hitler\nwas beaten.6 There was no reason to doubt that Stalin would be as\ngood as his word. The Russians undoubtedly had greaot ambitious in\nthe East. If Hitler was beaten, say, by January, and Japan was con-\nfronted with the three most powerful nations in the world, they would\nundoubtedly have cause for reflection as to whether they could continue\nthe fight.\n  THE PRESIDENT referred to the almost fanatical Japanese tenacity.\nIn Saipan not only the soldiers but also the civilians had committed\nsuicide rather than be taken.\n  SIR CHARLES PORTAL said that he hoped to have available between\n600 and 800 heavy bombers for operations against thie mainland of\nJapan. These could be supplemented by a considerable number of\nmedium bomber squadrons.\n  THE1 PRIME MINISTER asked about the employment to be made of\nthe British Fleet.\n  THE PRESIDENT said his thought was to use it in any way possible.\n  ADMIRAL KING said that a paper on this subject had been prepared\nfor reference to the Combined Chiefs of Staff.7 The question was being\nactively studied.\n  THE PRIME MINISTER asked if it would not be better to employ the\nnew British ships in place of battle-worn vessels of the United States.\n  I Concerning Stalin's statement on this subject at the Tehran Conference,\nsee\nForeign Relations, The Conferences at Cairo and Tehran, 1943, pp. 489, 499-500.\n  7The paper referred to was circulated as C.C.S. 452/27, September 13, 1944,\npost,p. 447.\n317\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
