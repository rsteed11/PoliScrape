PASVOLSKY said that the Committee on Security Aspects of\nPreparation for the United Nations Conference  had recommended\nthat no changes be made in Section C, a statement which was con-\nfirmed by MR. DUNN. MR. PASVOLSKY further remarked that con-\nsideration had been given to proposals of foreign governments with\nrespect to this chapter, but that it had been agreed to support none\nof these proposals. SENATOR CONNALLY then asked if the Delegation\nwere agreed as to making no changes, and without objection, the\nsection was allowed to stand.\n  MR. DULLES indicated, however, that, as paragraph 2 of Section C\nstood, any permanent member of the Security Council could veto\nenforcement action under a regional arrangement, whereupon SEN-\nATOR CONNALLY read the paragraph in question and MR. PASVOLSKY\nconfirmed the power to veto. Both MR. DULLES and COMMANDER\nSTAssEN interposed that this would permit France and China, for\nexample, to veto American regional action in the Western Hemisphere.\nSENATOR CONNALLY thought that the Security Council could veto\nenforcement action in a region but that no one power could veto an\ninvestigation.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY replied that parties to a dispute could use any\npacific means of their own choice to settle a question, but that the\nSecurity Council had a right to call on them to settle by pacific pro-\ncedure according to regional arrangements at their disposal. The\nSecurity Council, under paragraph 1 of Section C, had the authority\neither under the initiative of regional arrangements or of the Security\nCouncil to seek for settlement. The only time the Security Council\nwould come into the picture was when the procedure was moving\ntoo slowly, but it could not stop the procedure.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN declared, however, that any one of the Great\nPowers might veto action, nothing new had been added to the instru-\nments of pacific procedure by Chapter VIII, Section C, and the pro-\ncedure was subject to the veto of any one Great Power. MR. PAS-\nVOLSKY pointed out that provision had been made, in this respect,\nfor unanimous agreement of the Great Powers. REPRESENTATIVE\nEATON wondered whether the whole concept had not been based on\nthe assumption of a dispute between minor nations and asked what\nwould happen if a dispute occurred, for example, between the United\nStates and the Soviet Union. MR. PASVOLsKY admitted that this was\nan important point. All the nations were obligated to settle their\ndisputes peacefully. If a dispute occurred between a small state and\na Great Power, the Security Council could recommend that the vote\n"5This ad hoc Committee, consisting chiefly of the civilian and military\nad-\nvisers and experts assigned to the delegation, held four meetings under the\nchair-\nmanship of Mr. Dunn, April 3-11, to consider the provisions on international\nsecurity in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals; the Committee\'s views on security\nprovisions were presented to the delegation on April 16.\n302\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0364&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0364&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0364&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0364&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0364&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0364&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0364&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0363&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0365&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0363&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0365&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0364&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
