PADILLA said that all the countries of Latin America had been\nglad to vote for the admission of White Russia and the Ukraine as\ninitial members of the Organization at the session of the Steering Com-\nmittee. He said he felt that this unanimous vote was a splendid indi-\ncation of unity among the powers represented here. He said in this\nconnection he wished to refer to a commitment which had been as-\nsumed by all the Latin American countries at the Mexico City Con-\nference in regard to Argentina. At that Conference, it had been\nagreed that if Argentina fulfilled certain conditions in accordance with\nthe spirit and contents of the Act of Chapultepec then, the other South\nAmerican countries- would accept her back into the American family\nof nations. He. added that the Argentine had fulfilled these condi-\ntions, had declared war on the Axis, and had subscribed fully to the\nplans set forth at Mexico City. He said that from the point of view\nof the Latin American countries Argentina had taken these steps in\nconfidence that the other Republics would keep their share of the\nbargain.

He said it would be a\nvery pleasant matter for the South American countries if this request\ncould be treated in the same spirit of cooperation and unity which they\nhad displayed in regard to White Russia and the Ukraine. He con-\ncluded expressing the hope that Mr. Molotov would find it possible to\nagree to this.\n  MR.
