MR. Hiss added that the invita-\ntion requested that they come for "informal consultation".17\n  DEAN GiLDERSLEEVE said that for the purpose of the record she\nwould like to make it clear that she had had a conversation with the\nrepresentatives of the I.L.O. who had inquired concerning what status\nthey would have, but that she herself had said nothing to them on the\nmatter. She recalled that the Delegation had decided that several\nof its representatives might well meet unofficially with the representa-\ntives of the five organizations at some opportune time.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG asked whether Mr. Hiss had accomplished his\nbusiness. MR. Hiss replied in the -affirmative. SENATOR VANDENBERG\nthen said "Goodbye".\n  RECONSIDERATION OF FoUR-POWER AMENDMENT OF REGIONAL\n     ARRANGEMENTS, CHAPTER VIII, SECTION C, PARAGRAPH 2\n  SENATOR CONNALLY called on Senator Vandenberg to present his\nproposal to- apply the same type of exemption to the "regional agree-\nments" of the Pan American Union under the Act of Chapultepec\nwhich we allow to our European allies in respect to our European\nenemies.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG indicated that he must have had a brain fag\nat the end of the meeting on Friday for he now felt that our proposal\nfor Chapter VIII, Section C, paragraph 2, made it impossible for\nus to face either our European friends on the one hand or our Latin\nAmerican friends on the other. He therefore had written the letter\nwhich the Secretary had distributed to the members of the Delegation\n(Letter by A. H. Vandenberg, May 5, 1945 18). He remarked that\nfrom his point of view the question of fortifying our position with\nour American friends was so utterly fundamental that he would hate\nto impair this position by any action that might be taken.\n  MR. BOWMAN reported that in the discussion that had taken place\nSunday on this question no one could recall clearly the objections raised\nby Mr. Stassen to the proposal, objections stated during the "bedroom\nsession." MR. BOWMAN asked Mr. Stassen to explain those objections 19\nif he was willing.\n  MR. STASSEN remarked that his objections concerned the clause which\ntook the whole European scene away from the Security Council, at\nthe same time leaving the entire Western Hemisphere within the\n  1TUNCIO Documents, vol. 1, p. 3.\n  Not printed;
