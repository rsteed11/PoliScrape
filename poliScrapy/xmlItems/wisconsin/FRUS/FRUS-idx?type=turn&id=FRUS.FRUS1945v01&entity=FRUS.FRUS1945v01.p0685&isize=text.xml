General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 623\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nbelieved that all exceptions should be strongly fought in the name of\nAmerican security. SENATOR CONNALLY asked Mr. Notter what he\nrecommended. MR. NoTTER proposed that we return to the provisions\nof the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. MR. ROCKEFELER stated that he\nwould be satisfied with the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals with a provi-\nsion for prior authorization for action under the Latin American\nsystem. He stated that the Latin Americans felt that the United\nStates had let them down and they were contemplating the disinte-\ngration of the Western Hemisphere system.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY thought that it would be necessary for the\nSecretary to see Mr. Molotov promptly and to tell him that we were\nagreed that we could not put over our proposed joint amendment.\nSince we did not have the votes we might ask him for a release from\nour proposals and then reconsider them. MR. BLoom asked whether,\nif we went back to Dumbarton Oaks, that would take care of the Act of\nChapultepec. MR. NOTTER thought that there was a danger of us\nselling out under the Act of Chapultepec simply in order to provide\nfor an ultimate event that would probably not take place.\n  MR. DUNN thought that there was no need for an exception for the\nWestern Hemisphere. If we went back to the original language of the\nDumbarton Oaks Proposals the Inter-American System would have\nadequate protection. He noted that the exception in our proposed\namendment was very similar to the exception formerly placed in\nChapter XII of the Proposals. In fact, he said, it was the same pro-\nvision in a different place. He questioned any decision that would\ncompound the number of exceptions. He wondered why the original\nlanguage of Chapter XII would not be perfectly satisfactory-.\n1! SENATOR CONNALLY noted that Mr. Molotov was wedded to protec-\ntion for his French treaty. MR. DUNN commented that Mr. Molotov\nhad his French treaty even under the old Chapter XII. MR. DUNN\nsuggested that if we proposed an exception for the Western Hem-\nisphere the Soviet Union would want to extend its exception over all\nregional arrangements without any limitation. We had successfully\nnarrowed down our exception to rights already in the Proposals. If\nwe now request an exception for the Western Hemisphere the pres-\nsure will be great to arrange exceptions for all regional arrangements.\nMR. DuLLEs questioned whether or not the basic question was to save\nour position in Western Europe.\n  MR. STASSEN said that even if Great -Britain and other countries\nfavored additional exceptions he felt that we should oppose them\nsince they would tend to destroy the world organization. SENATOR\nCONNALLY asked whether the regional organization could function\nunder the original language of the. Dumbarton -Oaks Proposals. MR.\nDUNN replied in the affirmative, noting that the regional organiza-\ntion would have to be consistent with the General Organization.
