Continued German resistance is chiefly due to the fanatical\ndetermination of the Nazi Party leaders to fight to the end and to their\npossession of the necessary political and psychological control within\nGermany. This determination is based on the doctrine held by the\nNazis that Germany surrendered too quickly in 1918; their fear for\ntheir own safety; a fanatical belief in their own capabilities which\nprevents them from accurately appraising the situation; and the lack\nof any alternative to continued resistance which would seem to offer\nopportunities for a later revival of their power. It is possible that\npreparations are being perfected to maintain, even after defeat, an\nunderground organization. The failure of the coup d'etat of 20 July\nhas given the Party still more complete control of both the home front\nand the TWehrcmacht. The civilian population alone has neither the\ncourage nor the capacity to risk revolt, even if it is beginning to ap-\npreciate the hopelessness of continued resistance. In the Army, dis-\ncipline remains reasonably firm although the confidence of the rank\nand file is being undermined by the shortage of men, munitions, motor\ntransport, and liquid fuels and by the inescapable contrast between\nGerman and Allied artillery and air power. Therefore although the\nstrategic situation indicates certain defeat, German resistance is likely\nto continue beyond the time when any rational objectives within the\nimmediate or distant future seem to be served by doing so.\n3. Symptoms of German Collapse or Surrender\n  There are still no certain indications that German groups are acting\nas though collapse or surrender is imminent. Despite the plot of 20 July\nand the fact that the promotion of SS officers had a bad effect on the\nmorale of officers of the Army proper, there is no evidence that the\nofficer corps or the rank and file of the Army has been generally and\nseriously demoralized. Although surrenders are occurring more\nreadily than formerly, large scale mutinies or desertions have not yet\ndeveloped. In certain areas German soldiers continue to fight tena-\nciously but elsewhere they have lost the will to resist and only disci-\npline prevents a complete collapse of morale. On tmhe home front,\nstrikes and demonstrations have apparently not yet assumed danger-\nous proportions. Serious peace feelers have not been put forth by the\nGermans, but the satellite states, which might be expected to break\naway from a defeated Germany before final collapse, have already\nbegun to do so.\n4. Form of Surrender\n  Since it is unlikely that the present German Government or any\nNazi successor will surrender, the end of German resistance is most\nlikely to come through a series of piecemeal surrenders by German\narmed forces in the field.
