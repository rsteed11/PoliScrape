MR. Srn   owm indicated that this addi-\ntion paralleled the idea that had developed at the Hot Springs Con-\nference that the Organization would not take the action but rather\nthat the nations would take the action.4\'\n  DEAN GTIDERSLEEVE said she would like to-say a few words on this\nproposal. She said she had been confronted with a good many ques-\ntions as what the term "humanitarian" meant. She had wondered\nwhether it would not be well to spell out what was meant, for example,\nhealth, education, control of opium traffic, etc. But in spelling out,\nthe list seemed to get too complicated and she now wondered whether\nit would not be satisfactory simply to mention health and cultural\nrelations so that the final phrase would read "the solution of inter-\nnational, economic, social, health, cultural and other related problems."\nSenator Connally stated that the enumeration of any fields tended\nto exclude other fields. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE replied that this was\ntaken care of by the phrase "and other related problems". She said,\nhowever, that she recognized the advantage in leaving the text as it\nstood in the I2umbarton Oaks Proposals as long as one had authority\nto state what was included under the term "humanitarian". THE Sio-\nRETARY said that Dean Gildersleeve was correct in interpreting hu-\nmanitarian to include social, cultural and health problems. He said\nhe remembered that late one Sunday night at Dumbarton Oaks they\nhad wrestled with the interpretation of "social and other humani-\ntarian".42 It had been agreed that this phrase included education,\nhealth, narcotics and cultural relations. He asked Dr. Bowman if\nthis interpretation was accurate. DR. BowmAN indicated that the\ninterpretation had been just inclusive enough to allow him to go along\nwith it. THE SECRETARY thought it would be preferable to leave the\nmatter in general terms rather than to attempt to list the various fields\nin detail.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE replied that she had recently received a letter\nwith very important backing proposing the establishment of an\nOffice of International Education. She said the situation would be\nsatisfactory if she was authorized to say that the United States Dele-\ngation interpreted the text of the proposals, particularly the phrase\n"to facilitate solutions of international, economic, social and other\nhumanitarian problems" as providing future opportunities for the\n  \' Preamble to Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe\nUnited Nations; for documentation on the United Nations Conference on Food\nand Agriculture, Hot Springs, Virginia, May 18-June 3, 1943, see Foreign\nRela-\ntions, 1943, vol.
