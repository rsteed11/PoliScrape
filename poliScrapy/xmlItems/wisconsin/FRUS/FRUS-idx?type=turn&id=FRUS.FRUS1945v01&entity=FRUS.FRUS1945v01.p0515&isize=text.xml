He said that\nMr. Hiss, on Wednesday night, had talked to Sir Alexander Cadogan\nand that he, Mr. Dunn, had talked to Sir Alexander on Thursday\nmorning regarding this matter. MR. DUNN said that it was his under-\nstanding that Mr. Eden hoped that Field Marshal Smuts or Prime\nMinister King would present the Secretary's name as the President\nof the Conference, and later, at the Steering Committee meeting,\nMR. EDEN said that he himself would do it. Instead, however, Mr.\nEden made the proposal that the Conference have four Presidents\nagnd that each one of the four should rotate as presiding officer at\nthe plenary sessions, with the United States representative being\nChairman of the Steering and Executive Committees.\n  MR. DUNN said that Mr. Molotov had proposed in the Steering\nCommittee that the Conference have four Presidents of equal status,\nand that the Conference be run by the four Presidents equally and\ntogether. Mr. Padilla had been caught unawares by the British pro-\nposal, since he had expected to second the nomination of the Secretary\nto be the President of the Conference and the other three representa-\ntives of the sponsoring Governments to be Vice-Presidents. Conse-\nquently, Mr. Padilla, in speaking to the point in the Steering\nCommittee meeting, had to make his case on the basis of the precedent\nat Inter-American Conferences, and was forced to make the original\nmotion proposing the election of the Secretary as President and the\nrepresentatives of the other three sponsoring Governments as Vice--\nPresidents.\n  MR. DUNN reported that Mr. Molotov had made a strong speech\nin reply to Mr. Padilla's proposal, pointing out that the Soviet Gov-\nernment considered it a principle of equality and unanimity among\nthe four Governments that the Soviet proposal of four Presidents be\naccepted. Mr. Molotov had implied that Mr. Padilla had made a\nprepared speech. Mr. Padilla replied-Mr. Dunn reported-that his\nspeech had been prepared on the basis of the traditional operations\nof Conferences in the Western Hemisphere.\n  MR. DUNN reported that considerable confusion had then developed\nin the Steering Committee, with Field Marshal Smuts favoring the\nSoviet proposal, although it was originally understood that he had\nbeen furthering Mr. Eden's proposal. Mr. Fraser of New Zealand,\nin effect, also supported the Soviet proposal. On the other hand,\nrepresentatives of the other American republics clearly favored the\nproposal advanced by Mr. Padilla.\n  MR. DUNN further reported at this point in the Steering Committee\nmeeting that the Secretary made it clear that the United States could\nnot accept the Molotov or Eden proposals. MR. DUNN explained that\nunder the Eden proposals, the Conference would have four presidents\nwho would preside in rotation at the plenary sessions, with the Secre-\n453\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0515&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0515&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0515&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0515&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0515&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0515&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0515&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0514&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0516&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0514&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0516&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0515&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
