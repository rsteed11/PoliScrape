NOBLER reported that the Russians had expressed concern to\nhim with respect to the practice of appointing subcommittees with\nonly one or a few of the major powers represented. GOVERNOR STAS-\nSEN expressed the view that it was desirable, in the interest of Five\nPower unity, that the membership of all subcommittees should in-\nclude the Five Powers. Tim SECRETARY said that he would take these\nmatters up with Mr. Hiss immediately.\n   DIscusSION OF QUESTIONS PENDING BEFORE COMMITrEE III/1\n   The Delegation now proceeded to a discussion of pending ques-\ntions before Committee III/1 on the basis of US Gen 120.84\n  3. Should the General Assembly participate in decisions of the\nSecurity Council with respect to coercive measures? In view of the\naction of Committee III/3 in defeating amendments to VIII-B-4\noffered by New Zealand, Mexico, and Egypt,85 it was agreed that par-\nticipation by the Assembly in such decisions was no longer an open\nissue.\n  4. Should the Yalta decision stand which allows a permanent m-emn-\nber to veto peaceful settlement of a dispute to which it is a party?\nGeneral dissatisfaction was expressed with respect to the applicability\nof the veto to procedures for peaceful settlement. Pointing out that\nfifteen amendments had been proposed with respect to this matter,\nGOvERNOR STASSEN took the position that a change would be highly\ndesirable and suggested that the American Delegation take the posi-\ntion that decisions relative to peaceful settlement should be made by\na majority of seven, including at least three of the permanent mem-\nbers of the Council. It was further suggested that the question\nshould be taken up in the Subcommittee of Five. In response to a\nquery from Mr. Dunn, GOVERNOR STASSEN said that he thought that\nthe Yalta formula was subject to an interpretation which would\nexempt procedures of peaceful change from the veto and directed\nattention to Mr. Eden\'s recent press statement which seemed to sup-\nport such a position. MR. DUNN, however, took the view that it was\nnot just a matter of interpretation but of change in the Yalta formula\nand pointed out that the British had issued a correction regarding\nMr. Eden\'s reported statement. After MR. BLAISDELL drew attention\nto the Department\'s press release of March 24 on this subjects the\nview was accepted that the proposal would clearly involve a departure\nfrom the Yalta decision. It was agreed, furthermore, that in no event\n84 Not printed.\n85 Doe. 289, III/3/11, May 13, and Doc. 355, III/3/17, May 16, ibid., vol.\n12,\npp. 602 and 326, respectively.\n"6 For statement by Acting Secretary Grew on operation of the proposed\nvoting\nprocedure in the Security Council, see Department of State Bulletin, March\n25,\n1945, p. 479.\n770\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0832&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0832&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0832&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0832&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0832&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0832&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0832&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0831&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0833&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0831&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0833&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0832&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
