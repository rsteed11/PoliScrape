General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 123\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n  I then referred to the Cole Bill 52 which would turn over the admin-\nistration of all our territories to the Navy. The President said that\nhe had not been informed about this bill, and appeared to be interested.\n  I told the President about the conversations I had been having with\nthe Under Secretary of the Interior, Abe Fortas, regarding the possi-\nbility of the United States, at an auspicious time, volunteering to\nhave our own territories report to the Organization, and also to\nrespond to requests from the Organization for specific information.\nThe President said he would approve of this and that it might provide\na useful trading point at San Francisco.\n                              ARABIA\n  The President said that one of the most important goals we must\nhave in mind for the post-war world is to increase the purchasing\npower of great masses of people who now have a negligible purchasing\npower. He said a case in point was Arabia.\n  He spoke of his meeting with Ibn Saud*53  The President said that\nhe had told Ibn Saud that essentially he, the President, was a business-\nman; that he had been the head of a big insurance company-the\nMaryland Casualty; that as a businessman he would be very much\ninterested in Arabia. He told Ibn Saud that he knew considerable\nof the history of Arabia and had always been interested in that coun-\ntry; that Arabia needed irrigation projects; that it had plenty of\nwater about-sixty feet below the surface; that it had oil; that, using\ntheir own oil for fuel as operating pumps, they could develop an\nirrigation system in Arabia. He said that he told the King that if he,\nthe President, were in the pump business, he would regard Arabia as\na great potential market, and that the development of irrigation proj-\nects would increase the productivity of the land and considerably\nincrease the purchasing power of the country which would be of great\nbenefit to the world.\n                         CARIBBEAN BASES\n  I told the President of my recent trip to the Caribbean bases with\nGeneral Brett,54 and outlined in brief to him the substance of my\nreport to the State Department.55  The President reacted to the report\nby saying, "We must keep the bases active and leave no room for\ndoubt that we are there to stay."\n,aH. J. Res. 55, providing- for administration and protection of territories\nand\npossessions of the United States by the Navy Department, introduced by Repre-\nsentative W. Sterling Cole of New York; no action was taken on this Bill.\n5 For a report on the President\'s meeting with King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia,\nsee Department of State Bulletin, February 25, 1945, p. 290.
