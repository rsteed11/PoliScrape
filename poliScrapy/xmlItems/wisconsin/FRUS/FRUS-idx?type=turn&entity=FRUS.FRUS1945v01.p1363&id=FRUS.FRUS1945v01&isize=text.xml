SENATOR\nCONNALLY declared that it was his understanding that Commander\nStassen, Mr. Armstrong, and Mr. Dulles were authorized to work out\nan acceptable solution. However, SENATOR C\'ONNALLY was of the\nopinion that the Delegation would prefer the insertion of a clause on\nwithdrawal in the report- of :the Committee rather than a clause tied\nto amendment procedure. [At this point, 10: 15 a. m., Mr. Pasvolsky\nand Mr. Hackworth left the meeting.] 57a\n                          TRUSTEE~mP\n  COMMANDER STASSEN reported that there might be a slight modifi-\ncation in the draft of Section A -of the Trusteeship Chapter, which\nthe Delegation had considered on the previous day.58 Commander\nStassen remarked that he had been having difficulty with the French,\nthe British, with Mr. Evatt, and with the Philippines. He declared\nthat he would keep in touch with the military advisers and would\nmake certain that the interest of the United States would be safe-\nguarded. Commander Stassen pointed out that, if agreement among\nthe disputing powers were not reached before the Committee met,\nthere would be a "grand battle" in the final meeting of the Committee.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked the Military Advisers whether they were\nsatisfied with the trusteeship draft and with the course of the discus-\nsions which were then underway. GENERAL FAIRCwLD -replied that\nthe Military Advisers had no reason to be dissatisfied since most of\nthe questions they had considered were not military at all but were of\na political nature.\n  [Here follow remarks by Mr. Rockefeller on the problem of lining\nup votes and remarks by Commander Stassen on the question of refer-\nring parts of the Charter to Congressional Committees.]\n                       DoTIO JURISDIcTION\n  MIR. DouuLs declared that there would be a tremendous argument\non the subject of domestic jurisdiction at that day\'s meeting of Com-\nmittee I/1. MiR. DULLEs declared that, unless adequate support were\nobtained from- Mr. Rockefeller, the major powers would be defeated.\nThere was an attempt to re-insert in the paragraph on domestic juris-\ndiction the wording "disputes arising out of matters which by inter-\nnational law are solely within the domestic jurisdiction . . .". This\nwording had been in the original Dumbarton Oaks Proposals; and a\ngreat de4.9f support was being enlisted to re-insert it. MR. DuLus\ndeclared that he did not like the wording and thought it was nebu-\nlous. Mr. Dulles asked the Senators whether they thought it was\nessential that this phraseology be kept out of the Charter.
