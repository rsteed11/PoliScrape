Min. 25\nMinutes of the Twenty-Fifth Meeting of the United States Delegation,\n      Held at San Francisco, Wednesday, May 2, 19J#5, 9 a. m.\n                     [Informal Notes-F3lttract~s\n  \'[Here follows list of names of persons (24) present at meeting.],\n  SENATOR CONNALLY stated that ihe Chairman ofthe Delegation had,\nrequested him the previous evening to preside at. this meeting. He"\nasked Mr. Hackworth to proceed with his. report otn the International\ndourt of Justice.\n  MR. HACKWORTH stated that there were three questions as to which\nthe United\' States Delegation should take a position so\' that we could\nknow what the United States\' views were in the Committee proceed-\nings. He observed that he had talked to Sir William Malkin of the\nUnited Kingdom, who had told him that the British Delegation had\nmade up its mind "with respect to the court. MR. HACKWORTH said he\ndid\' not know what the British position \'was yet. The three questions\nto be decided were: (1) Continuity of the court, which had been left\nopen in Washington as it was largely political; (2) nomination of the\njudges of the court; (3) compulsory jurisdiction-MR. HACKWORTH\nthought it had been decided the other day that the present optional\nclause should be retained.33 SENATOR CONNALLY told Mr. Hackworth\nthat it had been definitely decided to keep the optional clause. MR.\nHACKwORTH asked the Delegates for guidance on these questions to\nenable him to discuss them with the British, Russians, and Chinese,\nso as to reach some sort of understanding in Commission IV.\n  MR. DUNN suggested that perhaps Mr. Hackworth and the legal\nrepresentatives of the other sponsoring powers might be added to the\nSubcommittee of the four sponsoring powers which was discussing-\nthe changes in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals.34  He thought that\nby bringing in the legal representatives, this group could discuss those\npoints there. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM noted that Mr. Hackworth was\nasking for the Delegation\'s decisions on these matters before going\ninto the small Subcommittee.\n              CONTINUITY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE\n  SENATOR CONNALLY then said that with regard to the continuity of\'\nthe court, he understood that if the old court were retained, its present\nname would be retained as would its statute with some modifications.\n3 See minutes of the meeting of April 30, 9: 30 a. m., p. 488.\n3 The Four-Power Deputies held four consultative meetings on suggested\namendments to Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, April 29-May 2;
