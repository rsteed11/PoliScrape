The Ambassador replied that his instruce\ntions were specific on this subject.\n  The Secretary then said that he proposed, at the morning session, to\ndesignate Mr. Hackworth as temporary chairman.60 The Committee\nwould then meet in the afternoon and elect a permanent chairman.6"\nThe British had informed us that they would nominate Mr. Hack-\nworth, and the Chinese that they would second the nomination. The\nSecretary inquired as to what the Soviet representative would do.\nWould he present the Soviet proposal and have the Committee vote\non it?\n  The Ambassador said that he would have to think the matter over,\nbut that he felt he must maintain his proposal.
