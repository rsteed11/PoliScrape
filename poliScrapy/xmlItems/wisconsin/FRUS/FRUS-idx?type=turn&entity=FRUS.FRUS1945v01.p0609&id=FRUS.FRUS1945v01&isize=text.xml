MR. DuuLiys thought it desirable to propose discussing\nthis amendment with the Russians. MR. PASVOLSEY thought that part\nof it would be all right, namely the phrase "without distinction as\nto\nrace, language, religion or sex." SENATOR VANDENBERG said that was\nall right with him; however, if the right to work and to education\nwere named, then there was a long list that should be added such as\nfreedom of assembly, freedom of religion, etc. SENATOR CONNALLY\nsaid that freedom of the press and freedom for the exchange of infor-\nmation and freedom to petition should also be included in that case.\nThere was agreement on this suggestion.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY drew attention to the Soviet proposal for amend-\nment of paragraph 6 of Section B, Chapter V, which is the same as\nthe proposal just discussed. He pointed out that the Soviet Delega-\ntion was not making any proposal about the revision of treaties or\nthe principles of the Atlantic Charter. SENATOR VANDENBERG said\nthat the Americans really wanted to go farther in this paragraph than\nthe Russians.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY called attention to the Soviet proposal on para-\ngraph 2 of Section C, Chapter VIII. [After the phrase "without the\nauthorization of the Security Council" add the clause "with the\nexcep-\ntion of measures provided for in treaties or concluded directly against\nthe renewal of the policy of aggression on the part of the aggressor\nstates in the present war."]\n  MR. PASVOLSKY said that he did not like this particularly. It had\nbeen drafted to take care of the Soviet agreement with France. The\nBritish, however, were working on a redraft. MR. ARMSTRONG said\nthat Mr. McCloy before leaving had asked him to say that he hoped\nthis matter would be left open until the Military Advisers had had a\nchance to express themselves.\n  MR. PASVOLsKY drew attention to the fact that the proposed amend-\nment to paragraph 1 of Section A, Chapter IX was simply a repeti-\ntion of the amendments proposed for paragraph 6 in Section B,\nChapter V and paragraph 3 in Chapter I.\n  MR. PAsvoLsKY read the suggested amendment to Chapter X [sub-\nstitute the following for the present paragraph 1: "There should be\na Secretariat comprising a Secretary General, four deputies and such\nstaff as may be required. The Secretary General and his deputies shall\nbe elected by the General Assembly on recommendation of the Se-\ncurity Council for a period of two years and the Secretary General\ncannot be immediately re-elected. The Secretary General shall be\nthe chief administrative officer of the Organization.""]\n  MR. PAsvoLsKY said this was a very important proposal. He\nthought the United States Delegation would not like it, and the Dele-\ngates agreed that they definitely did not like such a short term with\n547\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0609&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0609&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0609&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0609&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0609&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0609&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0609&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0608&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0610&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0608&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0610&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0609&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
