Sidney Hill-\nman and Henry Wallace,71 he declared, could use this clause to pro-\nmote their own economic theories. SENATOR CONNALLY ventured the\nopinion that too much emphasis had been given in the Charter to\neconomic and social considerations anyhow. The Senate would prob-\nably ask if a word [world] WPB 72 or WPA 72a would next be estab-\nlished. MR. DULLES indicated that the Negro problem in the South\nmight cause some Southern Senators to oppose this provision. DEAN\nGILDERSLEEVE remarked that she had stressed the need, in the Commit-\ntee, for care in view of the necessity of ensuring Senate ratification of\nthe Charter. She had emphasized that there was "no difference in\nfundamental aims" among the various parties to the discussion. SEN-\nATOR CONNALLY declared that in his view full employment was like the\nGolden Rule, toward which one could aspire but which one could\nnever attain. SENATOR VANDENBERG declared that if the question arose\nin the Senate he would refer the Senators to this statement by Senator\nConnally.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY maintained that domestic jurisdiction would\nnot be impaired by this clause and expressed confidence that it would\nbe possible to satisfy the Senate in this regard. Senator Vanden-\nberg, he declared, was agile enough to meet any objections raised in\nthe Senate. SENATOR CONNALLY declared that the Organization would\nhave only powers of recommendation on the question of full employ-\nment. In addition, the domestic jurisdiction clause would close the\ngate to international intervention with the exception of Chapter VIII,\nSection B.\n  DR. BOWMAN thought that our vulnerability lay in the first two\nlines. An opponent of the proposal would probably accept the validity\nof Chapter II paragraph 7. However, the legal position established\nhere was not consistent with the general truth established at the same\ntime that full employment was necessary for world peace. This in-\nconsistency, he declared would provide grounds for political attack.\nSENATOR CONNALLY replied that there would undoubtedly be attacks\nof this nature in any event but MR. ROCKEFELLER declared that he was\nconcerned over the possibility of propaganda arising over this incon-\nsistency during times of unemployment which he was certain could\nnot be avoided. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said that she understood that\nthe Organization would work toward this goal and she ventured the\nopinion that international collaboration could help in advancing to-\nward the attainment of this objective. SENATOR VANDENBERG asked\nwhether anyone had cited specific examples of the type of collabora-\n71 Henry A.
