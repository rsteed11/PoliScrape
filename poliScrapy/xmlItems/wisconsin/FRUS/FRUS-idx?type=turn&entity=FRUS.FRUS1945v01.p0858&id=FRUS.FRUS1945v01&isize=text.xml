He believed we would play directly into Russian propaganda,\nand swould in fact reinforce their hand, particularly in the Far IFast.\nMR. BOWMAN stated that inrorder not to play directly into anybody\'s\nhand we were establishing the system of trusteeship.\n  MR. STASSEN pointed out that he was still trying to negotiate the\nposition adopted as early as April 26 ?&#176; when this country favored the\nstatement "to promote the political, economic, and social advancement\nof the trust territories and their inhabitants and their progressive de-\nvelopment toward self-government in forms appropriate to the vary-\ning circumstances of each territory". MR. STASSEN asked whether it\nwas now the intention of the Delegates to change their position.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY pointed out that this was an extremely crucial issue\nand that there were important arguments to be made on both sides.\nle thought that- too much emphasis on independence as the sole goal\nwas bad. On the other hand, emphasis on independence was in our\ntradition. Earlier,- in order to meet this dilemma, we had suggested\na double formula by which a dependent territory might develop either\nin the direction of independence or in the direction of voluntary as-\nsociation with another state or group of states. This formula still\nseemed useful, and MR. PASyOLSKY wondered whether Mr. Stassen had\nbrought it to the attention of the British. - MR. STASSEN said he had\ntried out the formula informally and that the British had opposed it.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM conemented that the way the argument went\nthe previous day the Soviet Union seemed to want something more\nthan was suggested in Mr. Pasvolsky\'s formula. MR. ROCKEFELLER\nnoted that the backward peoples faced a basic conflict. If they\nachieved independence, the assistance, Which they needed from the\nlarger states to advance their economic and social status, would col-\nlapse. He thought that this conflict was handled as satisfactorily as it\ncould be in Mr. Stassen\'s formula. MR. NOTTER pointed out that there\nwas no fundamental difference in objective between those who favored\nself-government and those who favored independence, since self-gov-\nernment implied the possibility of independence. The difference was\nin the approach, and he felt that in opposing independence we were\nputting ourselves in a position to be played for suckers.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY thought we could dress up the formula read by Mr.\nStassen with more emphasis on voluntary association and with greater\nemphasis on independence as an ultimate goal. THE SECRETARY urged\nthat an effort be made in the direction suggested by Mr. Pasvolsky and\nwondered whether it would not be possible to include the word "in-\ndependence" in the formula to be adopted. MR. TAUssIG indicated\nthat in the last analysis he thought the dependent peoples would prefer\ntheir integrity under the United States to the proclamation of Russia\n20 See draft United States proposal on arrangements for international trustee-\nship, April 26, p. 459.\n796\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0858&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0858&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0858&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0858&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0858&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0858&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0858&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0857&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0859&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0857&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0859&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0858&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
