General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 61\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nto provide for the existence of the Secretariat and for a chief admin-\nistrative officer; and that the question of whether or not the naming\nof assistant secretaries should be incorporated in the Charter would\nbe a matter for discussion at the conference in connection with what-\never other elaboration might be desirable. Referring to the sugges-\ntion that the names of three instead of one candidate should be sub-\nmitted, he remarked that this was a matter also to be discussed in\nconnection with the procedure to be established. He said that it had\nnot been thought necessary at this stage to amplify this point because\nit was a matter that would be discussed anyway by the conference in\nterms of how much of the future regulations should be embodied in\nthe Charter.\n  In connection with paragraph 2 which proposes that the Secretary\nGeneral "should act in that capacity" with regard to the General\nAssembly, the Security Council, and the Economic and Social Coun-\ncil, DR. PASVOLSKY explained that it had been necessary to provide\nfor a single chief administrative officer, but that since obviously one\nman could not do the whole job, assistant secretaries would be nec-\nessary. He said that the term for which the Secretary General would\nbe elected had not been specified, the thought having been that this was\na matter which should also be discussed and determined at the Con-\nference itself. As regards the Mexican commentary to the effect that\nthe Secretary General be elected for ten years, DR. PASVOLSEY stated\nthat many considerations were involved in this proposal and that if\nthe Secretary General were a good man, it would be desirable to keep\nhim for a long term.\n  DR. PASVOLSKY stated that the provision in paragraph 3 was some-\nthing new, in that the Secretary General is given the right to bring\nto the attention of the Council any matter which may threaten inter-\nnational peace and security. He said he understood by the Venezuelan\ncomment on this paragraph that the Secretary General should have\nthe same right with regard to the Assembly, and commented that the\nright of the Secretary General to bring matters before both the Assem-\nbly and the Security Council might be considered in connection with\nproposal to increase the powers of the Assembly.\n  Referring td the Commentary on the Chapter as a whole, DR. PAS-\nVOLSKY stated that the first point related to the seat of the Organiza-\ntion which of course had not yet been determined or discussed; and\nthat the next point was procedural and again a question of whether\nor not the Charter itself should contain this type of regulation or\nwhether it should be left for future determination.\n  The next point, he said, related to diplomatic immunities and priv-\nileges, which again was a question that had been left out of the Dum-\nbarton Oaks document because it was believed it was something to\nbe discussed in connection with the drafting of the Charter, and that\n61\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
