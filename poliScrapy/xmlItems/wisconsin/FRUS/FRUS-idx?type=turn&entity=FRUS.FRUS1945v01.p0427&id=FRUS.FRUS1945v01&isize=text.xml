MowTov stated that he agreed but expected that the United\nStates and Great Britain will see that these Republics are made\ninitial members of the organization.\n  MR. Smm    ims replied in the negative, stating that this was a\nmatter for the Conference to decide.\n  MR. MoLwov stated that the Soviet Government would form its\nown judgment as to how well we can carry out joint agreements by\nthe success that is achieved in electing these two Republics as initial\nmembers of the world organization.\n  MR. EJDmN replied that the favorable votes of Great Britain and\nthe United States were assured but that he could not speak for the\nother forty-four countries.\n  MR.

He then suggested that the chiefs of the delegations of the four\nsponsoring powers be elected chairman to act in rotation, and added\nthat he felt it would also be advisable to elect four vice-chairmen\nfrom other countries and thus set the tone of the Conference on a\nbasis of equality.\n  MR.
