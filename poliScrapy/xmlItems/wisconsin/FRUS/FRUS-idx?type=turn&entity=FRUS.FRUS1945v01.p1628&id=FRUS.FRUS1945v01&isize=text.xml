General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n Sponsorship by the Department of State of legislation resulting in the International Organizations Immunities Act of 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1557-1567 ff.\n\t\t\t\n PDF (4.2 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1566\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\nPresident authority to terminate the designation of any international\n-organization as being entitled to the benefits of the bill.\n  I am happy to note that if the Department of State offers the pro-\nposed bill to the Congress and recommends it as a useful aid to the\nforeign policy of the United States, the Department of Justice will\nnot oppose the legislation. I very much appreciate the cooperative\nspirit with which you have approached this problem. For the rea-\nsons previously explained to your Department in connection with the\nconsideration-of this proposal, the Department of State does believe\nthat the enactment of this legislation is important to the successful\nconduct of the foreign policy of the United States.\n  With respect to your suggestions for changes in the bill, I have\nthe following comments:\n  1. You state that the provisions of Section 7 are broader than exist-\ning provisions respecting foreign government offitials. Your attenm\ntion is directed to- the fact that Section 7 (a) provides that the privi-\nleges, exemptions and innunities specified therein to be enjoyed\nby representatives of foreign governments and officerse oid employees\nof international organizations (and members of the iimediate fami-\nlies of such representatives, officers and employees residing with them)\nshall be "the same privileges, exemptions, and immunities as are ac-\ncorded under similar circumstances to officers and employees, respec-\ntively, of foreign governments and members of their families". Para-\ngraphs (c) and (d) of Section 7, by amending Sections 3 and 15 of the\nImmigration Act approved May 26, 1924,20 would bring officers and\nemployees of international organizations into substantially the same\nstatus as foreign government officials. Therefore, I believe that the\npoint made in your letter, with which I am fully in sympathy, is ade-\nquately covered by the proposed bill. You also state that this De-\npartment might wish to consider whether subordinate employees\nshould be included in the exemptions at all. This point has been con-\nsidered by this Department, and it is believed impracticable to Battempt\nto differentiate between various classes of employees of international\norganizations. I believe that the practical answer to your point is\nthat international organizations -located in this country will find it\nexpedient to recruit for lower grade positions almost entirely from\npersons located in this country.\n  2. With respect to your comment concerning the procedure for de-\nporting a person admitted under the benefits of the bill whose con-\ntinued residence in this country has been determined to be undesirable,\nyour attention is directed to the fact that by virtue of the proposed\namendment in Section 7 (d) of Section 15 of the Immigration Act\n&#176;43 Stat. 154.\n41566\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0012.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1628&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1628&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1628&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1628&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1628&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1628&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1628&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1619&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1627&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1629&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1619&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1627&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1629&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1628&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
