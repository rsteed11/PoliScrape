In answer to speculation about the significance of the opening date,\nApril 25, when a USSR agreement with Japan would expire, I told the press\ngroup that the date was purely coincidental. For instance, I had suggested\nat\nYalta that Wednesday was always a good day to begin a. conference."\n(Ref-\nerence was to the 5-year neutrality pact between the Soviet Union and Japan\nwhich was concluded April 13, 1941, entered into force from April 25, 1941,\nand\nwas denounced by the Soviet Union on April 5, 1945. This agreement did not\nexpire April 25, 1945, but would continue in force another 5 years from April\n25,\n1946, unless denounced by one party a year before this expiration date.
