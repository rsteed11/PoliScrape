It was pointed out to Mr. Thors that a declaration of war\nagainst one of the Axis powers is still a requisite for signature of\nthe United Nations Declaration and that the Department had so far\nreceived no indication of a change in Icelandic opinion in this regard.\nMr. Thors admitted that it was highly improbable that Iceland would\ndeclare war on Germany and in fact stated that in his opinion such\na declaration at this late date would be ridiculous. He further stated\nthat a declaration of war on Japan was quite out of the question.\n  It appears, however, that Mr. Thors has suggested to his brother,\nthe Foreign Minister, that since the Ukraine and White Russia have\nbeen made members of the United Nations the Foreign Minister might\ntry the experiment of writing a private letter to Secretary Stettinius\nasking for an application for membership in the United Nations on\nbehalf of Iceland. Should the Foreign Minister request your views,\nyou may advise him in the sense of the first paragraph of this telegram.\n                                                                GREw\n                  CHAPTER V: MAY 8-MAY 31, 1945\n   Beginning of open Conference discussion of Dumbarton Oaks Pro-\n   posals and changes recommended by Sponsoring Powers and other\n   participating Governments; exploratory discussions in meetings of\n   United States delegation to establish position to be taken by U.S.\n   delegates on all matters in connection with Conference; consultative\n   meetings with other Sponsoring Governments and France to reach\n   unanimous agreement on final position to be taken in meetings of\n   the twelve technical committees by any one of the Five Powers with\n   respect to proposed amendments; informal consultative meetings of\n   United States delegates with Latin American representatives on re-\n   gional arrangements; Five-Power agreement reached with regard to\n   proposals on regionalism and trusteeship.\nRSC Lot 60-D 224, Box 96: US Cr. MW 33\nMinUtes of the Thirty-Third Meeting of the United States Delegation,\n        Held at San Francisco, Tuesday, May 8, 1945, 5 p. m.\n                       [Informal Notes-Extracts]\n  [Here follows list of names of persons (32) present at meeting.]\n  Senator Connally called the meeting to order at 5: 00 p. m.\n  38 In a note of May 10 to the Acting Secretary of State (not printed),\nthe Ice-\nlandic Minister expressed the desire of his Government to attend the San\nFran-\ncisco Conference, indicated that since the enemy in Europe had been completely\ndefeated, there could be no longer any question of Iceland\'s declaring war,\nand\nstressed the feeling of the Government and the people of Iceland "that\nthey have\nmade their contribution to the United Nations\' war effort by lending their\ncoun-\ntry for important military bases and by sacrificing the lives of many hundreds\nof\nseamen engaged in transportation of food to Britain and the United States."\n(500.CC/5-1045) The text of the note was telegraphed to San Francisco (tele-\ngram 75, May 7, 1945), but the Conference took no action on the Icelandic\nre-\nquest.
