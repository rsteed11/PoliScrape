PREPARATORY COMMISSION\nview of the divided opinion and strong feeling of some of the smaller\nstates that the Security Council was not 'sacrosanct' a vote finally\nbecame necessary on the omission of this recommendation. Brazil,\nChile, China, Czechoslovakia, Mexico, Soviet Union, USA, Yugo-\nslavia were in favor of omission; opposed to omission were Canada,\nAustralia, Iran, The Netherlands, UK and France abstained.\n  With respect to the second recommendation, Gromyko argued that\nit was wrong to treat the Security Council as a child that needed\nto be instructed on its first movements and that the substance of this\nrecommendation was covered in the terms of the Charter and need\n-not be repeated in this form. The only solution that proved gen-\nerally acceptable was to omit the recommendation to which Gromyko\n~objected, and rephrase the preamble to meet the desire of the smaller\nstates to express- the hope that the Security Council -would promptly\nbegin its work.\n  It was clear throughout the discussion that Gromyko was suspicious\ngof any effort by the smaller states through the Preparatory Commis-\n:sion to affect the organization and procedures of the Security Council\nbeyond its first meeting.\n  While they accepted their defeat in good spirit the Australian\nrepresentative made it clear that he would press in the Preparatory\nCommission for more detailed recommendations for the guidance of\nthe Security Council. His position like that of the Canadian repre-\nsentative was consistently that the Security Council under the interim\narrangements should be treated like any other organ for which the\nPreparatory Commission should make recommendations. The Aus-\ntralian Hiasluck argued in the Executive Committee that in view of\nthe very general nature of the provisions of the Charter and of the\nagreement on interim arrangements it would be more helpful to the\nSecurity Council if a complete set of rules of procedure and other de-\ntailed guidance were prepared for the benefit of the Security Council.\n  I believe this conflict of opinion regarding the responsibility of the\nPreparatory Commission for the Security Council will be revived\nagain in the discussions of the Preparatory Commission and that\nAustralia with the added strength of a number of smaller states may\nbe able to gather support for restoring in the report recommendations\ncomparable to those omitted in the Executive Committee as a result\nof the Soviet opposition.\nEconomic and Social Council.\n  Specialized Agencies.\n  The most significant reservation on the Economic and Social part\nof the Executive Committee's report relates to the Soviet attitude on\nthe problem of relations with specialized agencies.
