STASSEN said Mr. Fraser had scheduled a 10: 30 meeting on\nSaturday morning of the Trusteeship Committee.93 MR. STASSEN'S\nthought was that we would be in a bad psychological situation if\nour paper was not available for discussion at the committee meeting.\nHe said his thought was to go to Lodrd Cranborne and say that we were\nso far apart that it would take a long time to work out the differences,\nthat we had fulfilled our obligation to consult, that we now knew each\nother's position, and that we would now submit our papers to the\nConference before the midnight deadline. MR. DUNN said it would\nbe very important to get the British and Soviet agreement to this\nprocedure since we were committed by the Yalta agreement to a pro-\ncedure of consultation. He saw no reason why Mr. Stassen's proposal\nwould be unacceptable to the Soviet.\n  MR. STAssEN added that the Russians, French, and Chinese have\nindicated general interest in our paper and have indicated that they\nwould in general go along with it. Mh. DUNN suggested that Mr.\nStassen emphasize that we have consulted in accordance with the\nYalta agreement with a view to informing each other and that now we\nare under obligation to get our proposal in before the deadline. MR.\nSTAssEN indicated that we might also stress that we were not committed\nto agreement and that it looks as though the process of getting agree-\nment would be a long one. Mu. DUNN thought we had a good case.\nMR. STASSEN said he would talk to Lord Cranborne, and MR. DUNN\nindicated he would clear the matter with the Russian Delegation.\n  MR. HICKERSoN reported that MR. FRASER had expressed the opinion\nthat our paper on trusteeship was a fine one and that we could count\non his support, and that New Zealand would do everything in its power\nto meet our military requirements in the Pacific.\n  The meeting was adjourned at 10: 30 a. m.\nRSC Lot 60-D 224, Box 99: UNCIO Cons Four Min 4\nMinutes of the Fourth Four-Power Consultative Meeting on Charter\n    Proposals, Held at San Francisco, May 4, 1945, 12:1: ip. um.\n                         [Informal Notes]\n  [Here follows list of names of participants including Chairmen of\ndelegations of the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and\nChina, accompanied by their respective delegates, advisers and experts\n(not listed by name).]\n93 Doe. 113, II/4/2, May 6, UNCIO Documents, vol. 10, p. 423.\n598\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
