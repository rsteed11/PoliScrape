I discussed the question over the phone twice with Secre-\ntary Forrestal on Monday. First, I told him that the memorandum\napproved by him48 did not fit in with my views, and we decided the\nPresident should assemble everyone who was concerned and thrash\nthe matter out. Later I discussed more fully with Secretary Forrestal\nmy enforced position-a position taken by the Department without\nfull consultation with me-on the U. St policy for trusteeships.\nForrestal said that he and Secretary Stimson would write me a letter 49\nstating the views held by them and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thank-\ning him, I said that thereafter I could discuss the situation with\nPresident Roosevelt.\n  At the Tuesday meeting of my Staff Committee I reported that the\nPresident had replied 50 to our Trusteeships memorandum sent to him\non April 9, agreeing with our position outlined in the memorandum,\nand had suggested that State, War and Navy representatives discuss\nthe matter with him on April 19. I interpreted President Roosevelt\'s\nmemorandum as meaning that the trusteeship question should be dis-\ncussed at San Francisco (as agreed to at Yalta), that preliminary\nconversations with other Powers should take place after the meeting\non the nineteenth, and that there would be sufficient time to handle the\nproblem adequately, even with this delay. That evening (April 10)\nI phoned Secretary Forrestal that the President would like to see us\non the nineteenth regarding trusteeships, and suggested that Colonel\nStimson, Forrestal and myself "have the first appointment with the\nPresident when he returns". Forrestal remarked that Stimson would\nlike the Chiefs of Staff to be there also, and I said I had no objection.\nOn Thursday the twelfth I discussed trusteeships with Mr. Abraham\nFortas, Under Secretary of the Interior, and told him that I was going\nto the President on this subject with the Secretaries of War and Navy\nbefore I left for San Francisco. Fortas explained about a memo-\nrandum he had sent to the President, with a copy going to me a day\nearlier.5\' But I told him I had heard of the memorandum only from\nthe President. Half an hour later I phoned Secretary Forrestal par-\nticularly to ask if he would explain to Colonel Stimson that I was dis-\nassociated from the State Department memorandum on Trusteeships,\nand Forrestal promised to pass on to the Colonel the information that\nI was out of town when our mnemorandumr was prepared.\n4 Reference may have been to draft letter prepared by Secretary Stimson and\ndiscussed by the three Secretaries at the April 2 meeting in the War Depart-\nment (The Forrestal Diaries, p. 38).\n" No record of letter found in Department files.\n   See footnote 52, p. 211.\n   \' See memorandum of April 5 by the Secretary of the Interior (Ickes) to\nthe\nSecretary ol State, p. 198.\n210\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
