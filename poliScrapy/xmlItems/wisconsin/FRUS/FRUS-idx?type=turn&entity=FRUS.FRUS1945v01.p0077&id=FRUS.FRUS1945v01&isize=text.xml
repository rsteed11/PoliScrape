His evident purpose was\nto fix clearly in his mind our arguments in favor of the formula.\n  He then asked me if I would be willing to go over with him the\nother open items,22 and proceeded to enumerate them as they occurred\nto him:\n     1. The International Court of Justice 23\n     2. Dependent areas and international trusteeships24\n     3. Liquidation of the League of Nations 25\n     4. Initial membership 2"\n  With regard to the Court, he said tha\'c he considered the matter\nsettled in substance and that agreement on details should not be dif-\nficult to reach. The whole subject is being studied in Moscow on the\nbasis of our documents which were discussed at Dumbarton Oaks.27\nIThe discussion of the dependent areas matter was rather lengthy.\nHe said that he had been very much interested in the few -informal\nconversations we had on this subject at Dumbarton Oaks, but had\nnever had the opportunity to make a more systematic examination of\nthe subject. He mentioned the memorandum which Secretary Hull\nhad presented at the Moscow Conference 28 and (as Sobolev had told\nme in September 29) said that the Soviet Government was very favor-\nably impressed by it. He repeated the statement made by Sobolev\nthat, while the Soviet Government has neither colonies nor experience\nin colonial administration, it is greatly interested in the subject. He\nasked me if I would care to outline for him the principal problems\nin this field as we see them.\n  2 For a series of memoranda on open questions prepared for a conference\nwith the President on November 15, 1944, see Conferences at Malta and Yalta,\npp. 48-57.
