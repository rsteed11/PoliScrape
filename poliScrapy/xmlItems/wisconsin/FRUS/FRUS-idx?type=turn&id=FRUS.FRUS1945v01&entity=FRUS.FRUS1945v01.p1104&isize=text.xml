COM-\nMANDER STASSEN asked whether Mr. Pasvolsky could tell the Delega-\ntion who the parties under Chapter XII would be. MR. PASVOLSKY\nreplied that he did not know, and he explained that Chapter XII\nhad been written as it was, because it would be impossible to give a\nclear picture of which powers would be responsible for enforcement\naction, and which powers would be willing to relinquish their special\nposition as victors in the war and assume a position of equality with\nthe enemy states. He pointed out further, as an example of what\nmight result from the decisions of the United Nations that the Italian\nAdvisory Commission 31 had more than six members, but COMMANDER\nSTASSEN interjected that the decision as to which states should be mem-\nbers of the Italian Advisory Commission had been made by two or\nthree states. MR. PASVOLSKY replied that there was no way of telling\nwhat the situation might be after the war.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked if Commander Stassen would expand\non a statement he had made earlier in the meeting concerning the ap-\nplication of this paragraph to Russia, and Japan. COMMANDER STAS-\nSEN replied that on the termination of the war Russia might interpret\nthe word "regional" as signifying arrangements made with respect\nto\nJapan, without ever having participated in the Pacific war. In this\nway, arrangements made by Russia concerning the prevention of\nfuture aggression by Japan might be interpreted as not being subject\nto the enforcement authority of the Security Council.\n  MR. KANE asked whether he was correct in understanding that if\nthe change were adopted, the French would interpret the phraseology\nas requiring both the parties to regional pacts and those powers re-\nsponsible under Chapter XII, Paragraph 2 to join in the request for\nthe Security Council to assume jurisdiction. MR. PASVOLSKY replied\nthat this request could be made by any nation. Upon receipt of\nsuch a request the Security Council would get in touch with the\nother powers whose consent was necessary and put pressure on all\nthe parties concerned to agree to the transfer. MR. KANE asked\nwhether Mr. Pasvolsky did not think that this would require the\nconsent of all the United Nations. Mi. PASVOLSKY proposed, as an\nexample of what he meant, a situation where one nation raised the\nquestion of transferring the authority to the Security Council. The\nSecurity Council would then ask for the positions of all the other re-\n\' The Allied Advisory Council for Italy was established in conjunction with\nthe Allied Control Commission for Italy in accordance with an agreement reached\nat the Moscow Conference in October 1943; its membership included Great\nBritain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Greece, and Yugoslavia.\nThe first meeting of the Council was held at Algiers on November 30, 1943.\nFor\ndocumentation on this subject, see Foreign Relations, 1943, vols.
