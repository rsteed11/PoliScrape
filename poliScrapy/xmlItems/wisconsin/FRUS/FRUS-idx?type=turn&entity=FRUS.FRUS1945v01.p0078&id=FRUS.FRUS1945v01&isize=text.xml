General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 16\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATION'S, 1945, VOLUME I\n  I summarized for- him the various alternative approaches to suTch\nproblems as the distinction between trust and colonial areas; 30 the\npossible declarationr of general principles applicable to both; the\nniachinery of international trusteeship for detached areas; the pos-\nsibilities and structure of regional commissions for colonial areas ;. the\nquestion of international accountability; and the relation between the\ninternational organization and the' possiblq regional. comngssions. I\nsaid that our basic. thought ;runs generally in terms of the ideas ex-\npressed in Secretary Hull's memora-ndum and-that ;we consider our\ntreatment of the Philippines as a desirable type of i attitude towvard\ndependent areas.   .\n  In reply to his question as to, whether all of. thckse. problems would\nhave to be discussed at the United Nations Conference, I.said that\nonly questions relating to international trusteeshi prQperly, belong\non the agenda of the conference.. Colonial problems as such might be\ntouched upon, but probably ought to be taken up in earnest at some\nspecial conference or by some other means.\n  He inquired whether such a discussion of colonial problems would\ninvolve only the colonial powers or also the other important powers.\nMight it not even be appropriate, he asked, that such a discussion be\narranged by the future international organization, since the problems\nraised might well come within the scope of the General Assembly\nand the Economic and Social Council? I said that any one of these\nprocedures was possible.\n  He then said that he was certain that some trusteeship arrange-\nments for detached areas must be provided for in the Charter, and\nthat the matter really ought to be of direct concern to his Government.\nAfter all', he pointed -but, as a country at war with'Italy, the Soviet\nUnion will have to assume responsibilities with regard t6 Italian\ncolonies, and it may well have to assume responsibilities with regard\nto territories detached from Japan.\n  His next question related to the position of Great Brita'in and of\nother countries on this subject. I said that we have a tentative ar-\nrangement with the British to exchange documents relating to this\nquestion, and it is our intention to make our documents available. to\nthe Russians. I said I was sure that the British intended to proceed\nsimilarly. I recalled the fact that there are very interesting passages\non this subject in the Chinese memorandums.3  He said that they had\nfound the ideas of the,. Chinese very interesting and. would be very\nglad to study whatever documents we might give them.\n30 See memorandum of January 13, infra.\natr text of i tentative Chine, se pro poals for a General 4itq'rnational\nOrganza\ntion, August 2&amp;, 1944, see oreipn 1etafions, 1944, vol.
