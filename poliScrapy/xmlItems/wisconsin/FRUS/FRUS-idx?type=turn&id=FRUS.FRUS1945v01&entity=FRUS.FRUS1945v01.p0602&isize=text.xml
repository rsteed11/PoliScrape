General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 540\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\nagreed upon (after "measures" insert the following phrase "set\nforth\nin paragraphs 3 and 4 of this section"). He thought that the sug-\ngested alteration in paragraph 3 could be dropped if the proposals\nwith respect to paragraphs 1 and 2 were retained inserting after\n"decisions" "to maintain or restore peace and security".\nSENATOR\nCONNALLY asked if there was any opposition to retaining as an Amer-\nican proposal the suggested amendment to paragraphs 1 and 2. The\nDelegates agreed to this suggestion. He asked if there was any\nopposition to dropping the proposed amendment from paragraph 3.\nMR. DuLLEs said it could be dropped if the proposals for paragraphs\n1 and 2 are retained. The Delegates raised no opposition to deleting\nthis amendment.\n  Chapter IX, Arrangements for Economic and Social Coopera-\ntion.-MR. PASVOLSEY said that in Chapter IX it had just been agreed\nthat the word "cultural" should be inserted after "social"\nin Section A,\nparagraph 1, and that in Section D, paragraph 1 the phrase "a com-\nmission on human rights" should be inserted after the phrase "a\nsocial commission". SENATOR CONNALLY asked if the Delegation had\nany opposition now to these changes and there being none, he stated\nthat the Delegation agreed to the proposals.\n  Chapter X, The Secretariat.-MR. PASVOLSKY said that the pro-\nposed additional paragraph to Chapter X might encounter strong\nobjections and he wanted to be able to propose it to the other sponsors\nin order to have bargaining power on other provisions with regard to\nthe Secretariat. SENATOR CONNALLY asked if the Delegates agreed.\nThey assented.\n  Chapter XI, Amendments.-MR. PASVOLSKY said that all three- of\nthe governments had reservations on the American proposal for a new\nparagraph in Chapter XI. One reason for their opposition was that\nas it stands it makes it more difficult to have a conference for a\nthorough-going revision of the Charter than for amendments.\nNevertheless, he personally thought this proposal should be left in.\nCOMMANDER STASSEN agreed with him. SENATOR CONNALLY asked the\nDelegates if they agreed to offering this as -an American proposal.\nHe commented that according to this proposal the vote of seven Coun-\ncil members would be required, but with unanimity among the perma-\nnent members. However, ratification of a new draft Charter would\nrequire acceptance by all permanent members, and he thought that\nwould be enough of a veto for them to retain. SENATOR VANDENBERG\nsaid he was in favor of leaving this proposal as it had been drafted.\nSENATOR CONNALLY said he would like to have this known as his\namendment. He added that Hamilton Holt 64 had called upon him\nand said that the Charter should have a provision like this.
