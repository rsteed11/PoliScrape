MR. BIroom\nnoted that Senator Vandenberg\'s proposal was limited in time by\nthe phrase "until such time as the organization may, by consent of\nthe Governing Board of the Pan American Union, be charged with\nthis function". SENATOR VANDENBERG thought this proposal would\nbe acceptable. MR. BLOOM agreed that this limitation narrowed the\nexception and made it less objectionable. MR. IROCIEFELLER agreed.-\n  MR. STASSEN urged that to adopt Senator Vandenberg\'s amendment\nwould be to destroy the organization. If we intend to make this\nkind of a provision in Chapter VIII we should do it in Chapter I and\nrealize that we were undermining the whole effort.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER asked why Mr. Stassen had not objected to the\nweakening of the Organization by the exception for the Russian-\nFrench treaty. MR. STAssEN said he had strongly objected. He hoped\nthat the definition of enemy states could be narrowed and moreover\nhe thought it useful to point out that our amendment applied not\nonly to action by European states against enemy states but also to\naction-by any states in the world against former Axis states. The\nposition we had taken in the amendment in its present form is in line\nwith Senator Vandenberg\'s speech.22 MR. STASSEN said he believed\nthat it was not a general exception but was a limited and restricted\nexception that seems to have had the general approval of the public,\nif one can judge by the reaction to Senator Vandenberg\'s speech. MR.\nSTASSEN said he would not approve a further exception being made\nin the basic document itself. He would, however, go along with an\nagreement made in advance \'that the Western Hemisphere would\nreceive prior authorization to take action on local disputes. In this\nway the regional organization would be kept subordinate to the genr\neral organization. DEAN GILDERSLEEvE commented that we had as-\nsumed that some such blanket authorization in advance would be\nforthcoming. MR. McCi[oy indicated that he had recently talked\nwith some of his friends, both French and English, who had indicated\nthat they would support us on anything we wanted in connection with\nthe Monroe Doctrine. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said that Mr. Koo had\ntalked in the same vein. MR. McCLoy suggested that the problem\ncomes down to getting agreement with the Soviets.\n  MR. NOTrER stated that he could not refrain from pointing out-\nthat the proposed exceptions would wreck the international orga-\nnization. He felt that the present amendment that we had proposed,\neven without further exceptions, undermined the Organization since\nno time limit was indicated for the treaties and action might be taken\nunder them independently of the Organization forever. MR. NO&#182;rER\npointed out that our amendment gave legal sanction to our Allies\nto build up a system that could in time be turned against us.
