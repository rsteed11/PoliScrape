SENATOR VANDENBERG replied that the Atlantic Charter went\nfarther than many Senators liked.\n  MR. STINEBOWER suggested that if the words "encourage separate\nand cooperative action" were included in the Canadian amendment,\nthis should meet the objection. SENATOR VANDENBERG agreed but said\nthat two-thirds of the Senate would be hunting for some of Mr.\nWallace\'s ideas.\n  DEAN GU simeLFvi said that in the next sub-head of the Canadian\nproposal, i.e. (b), we would add the word "cultural". This and\n(c)\nwere agreed to by the Delegation.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE then asked our position on inclusion of the\nword "health". MRt. STINEBOWER said that several countries hope\nfor\nthe establishment of a consultative health organization. He felt that\nthe word "health" was probably not included in the word "cultural".\nSENATOR VANDENBERG said that he had less objection to "health"\nthan "education", and was willing to include "health",\nproviding we\nemphasize that we were not attempting to internationalize these\nfields but were to "encourage separate and cooperative action".\nHe\nsaid he objected to none of these ideas if they were adequately\nexplained.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE then brought up the British amendment (pp.\n10, 1481) which gives a special position to the ILO. She said that\nwe were not opposed to the ILO itself but did not believe it should\nbe singled out and givenspecial attention. COMMANDER STASSEN felt\nquite definitely that we should not have the Charter take sides in a\nlabor fight as would be done by the British amendment. DEAN GIL-\nDERSLEEVE said that the British reportedly had binding instructions\nregarding the ILO proposal. MR. ARMSTRONG said that Mr. Eden\nhad remarked that if the ILO were excluded, Mr. Attlee would "have\na fit but that there was to be a general election".\n  MR. STINEBOWER said that even if there were no labor fight regard-\ning the ILO, we still did not wish a special position specified for the\nILO in the Charter, since the ILO had been inclined to regard it-\nself as superior to all other agencies and to encroach upon their\nfields. He raised the question as to whether we should not have a\nline of retreat if necessary, namely to delete the British amendment\nbut to be willing to mention the ILO in some innocuous manner by\na phrase "such as the ILO". COMMANDER STASSEN declared that we\nshould have no line of retreat and that if necessary the United States\nshould reserve its position and carry the fight all the way up. This\nwas agreed.\n  DEAN GILDER5LEEVE said that Mr. Tomlinson of the U.K. had just\nrequested a meeting with the United States to go over the ILO\namendments. COMMANDER STASSEN said that we should tell Mr. Tom-\n  \' Ibid., pp. 308 and 312.\n689\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
