Thirty-three articles,\nhe explained, had already been covered, a number of which were\nnow under discussion in subcommittees. He added that there were\nabout four outstanding problems that he felt should be presented to\nthe Delegation so that he could have their guidance in further\nnegotiations.\n  Mi. HACKWORTH said the first problem was the method of election\nof jQgestohegoxt231 According to the present m           the\nCourt, judges are nominated by panels of judges on the Hague Court\nof Arbitration and are elected by the Council and the Assembly of\nthe League of Nations. He said the British were now proposing that\njudges be nominated directly by governments and that instead of the\nnine members of the present Court, fifteen should be elected. He\npointed out that this government doubted whether nine members\nwould be sufficient and that our tentative view was that the Court\nshould be kept at fifteen and that the present method of election\nshould be retained. Our primary objection to the British sugges-\ntion, he added, was that it would throw the whole matter into poli-\ntics. SENATOR CONNALLY asked whether states not members of the\nHague Court of Arbitration could participate in the election of judges\nto the Court. MR. HACKWORT replied in the affirmative and added\nthat where a state is not a member of the Hague Court, it may set\nup a panel of four to prepare a nomination.\n  THE SECRETARY asked what decision Mr. Hackworth wished from\nthe Delegation. MR. HACKWORTH replied that he wished to know\nwhether we should adhere to our present tentative position or go\nalong with the British. SENATOR CONNALLY favored retaining our\npresent position. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM thought that any change\nfrom the present system would permit states to gang up and pack the\nCourt. MR. HACKWORTH strongly recommended sticking to the pres-\nent method of election, adding that thisposvito   wted\nb     B   ~    r Association. MR. BLooM pointed out that while\nmnder the British proposal states would tend to nominate judges of a\nparticular political conviction, this same weakness was also present\nin the existing system since governments put men on the Hague tri-\nbunal that they considered "sound". MR. BOWMAN recommended\nthat we stick to the old method for the time being, but recognize that\nwe would prefer a better method if it could be developed.\n  THE SECRETARY questioned whether the Delegation was in a position\nto make a decision on this matter and wondered whether it would not\nbe wise to reserve our position until further study could be given to\n  aFor official comments on the Statute of proposed Court respecting the\nelection\nof judges (articles 8, 10-12, Statute of the Permanent Court of International\nJus-\ntice (P.C.I.J) ), see Conference Series No. 84: The International Court of\nJustice: Selected Documents Relating to the Drafting of the Statute (Depart-\nment of State publication No. 2491), p. 24.\n270\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
