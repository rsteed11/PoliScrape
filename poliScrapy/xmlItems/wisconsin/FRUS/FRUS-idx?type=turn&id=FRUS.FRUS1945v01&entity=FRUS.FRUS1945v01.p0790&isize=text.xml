General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 728\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1 945, VOLUME I\nstates contributing forces to the Organization would be consulted when\nthey were used. He noted that the British were sympathetic to this\nproposal and that Mr. Jebb had made a modified Canadian proposal 17\nwhich was before the Committee as Chapter VIII, Section B (US\nGen 103). SENATOR CONNALLY noted that the New Zealand amend-\nment 18 was now up, calling for Assembly approval by a majority vote\nof all Council decisions for enforcement except where urgency is in-\ndicated. SENATOR VANDENBERG, THE SECRETARY and MR. DuNN SUg-\ngested that this proposal should be voted down. SENATOR CONNALLY\nthought it would be a bad thing to accept the Canadian proposal to\ninvite states in as voting members of the Council. He was afraid\nthis would disturb the balance of a Security Council of eleven members.\nMR. EATON pointed that the Canadian problem was a political one\nat home.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG suggested that each member state had con-\ntrol over the conditions under which it would supply forces by means\nof the agreement under which forces would be supplied. MR. HICK-\nERSON thought it would be unsatisfactory to place a mandatory obli-\ngation upon the Security Council to invite in other states since this\nwould greatly slow up the procedure. THE SECRETARY suggested that\nif anyone providing facilities for enforcement action could also come\nin and ask for a vote the situation would shortly get out of hand.\nSENATOR CONNALLY pointed out that this matter would be pressed by\nthe Canadians. MR. HICKERSON noted that the only small country\nspeaking on our side was Norway."\' He added that the vote would\nbe taken today 20 on the New Zealand amendment. THE SECRETARY\nasked for the views of the Military Advisers. MR. GAP% indicated\nhis opposition to the Canadian proposal as well as to the New Zealand\nproposal, as did GENERAL EMBIcC.\n  MR. DuLms said we should not altogether ignore Canada\'s political\nproblem and that we should not be too arbitrary in this matter. SEN-\nATOR CONNALLY indicated that he had no objection to states that were\ncontributing forces being called in for consultation but that he did\noppose their being called in as members of the Council.\n  ADMIRAL WILLsoN commented that he had talked recently with a\nmember of the Soviet Delegation who had reminded him that we\nhad opposed the international police force on the grounds that our\nsystem would actually be more -effective. Now the Soviet Delegate\nfound, what he had suspected earlier, that our system was not going\nto be very effective and wondered whether we should not give power\nto an international police force. MR.
