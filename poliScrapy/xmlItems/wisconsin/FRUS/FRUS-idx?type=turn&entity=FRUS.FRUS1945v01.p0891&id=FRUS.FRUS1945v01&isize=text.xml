General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 829\n\n\nUN-ITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nwanted the Secretary to know that we were really up against the\nbuzz saw.\n       RELATIONS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL WITH        / E-\n               NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE asked for an opportunity to present a number\nof questions pending before a subcommittee meeting that morning at\n9:45. Mr. Stinebower and Mr. Mulliken then joined the meeting.\n  MR. STINEBOWER presented a compromise draft worked out in Sub-\ncommittee II/3/A. He pointed out that we had made an effort to\nget as much of the consultant\'s draft 50 into the proposal as possible,\nbut that the Soviet Union had spent two hours of discussion adamantly\nopposing putting so much emphasis on national non-governmental\norganizations. A draft had been worked out, however, which was\nnow generally approved by the Soviets, which read as follows:\n  "The Economic and Social Council shall be authorized to make suit-\nable arrangements for consultation with non-governmental organiza-\ntions, international and where appropriate national, which are con-\ncerned with matters within the competence of the Council."\nMR. ROCKEFELLER explained that there might be some reaction if- we\nopposed the consultants on this matter. They were particularly inter-\nested in getting away from narrow pressure groups and emphasizing\nnational groups. MR. DULLES questioned whether the draft suggested\nby Mr. Stinebower would be disapproved by the consultants. MR.\nSTINEBOWER thought we were in a rather vulnerable spot. The Rus-\nsians had said that we had emphasized that we could not envision the\nEconomic and Social Council going over the heads of governments\nand interfering in local domestic affairs. However, we were pro-\nviding that national associations, private ones, would work directly\nwith the Economic and Social Council. They felt we were somewhat\ninconsistent.\n  THE SECRETARY expressed the view that the draft would give the\nconsultants about what they wanted. MR. MULLIKEN and MR. DICKEY\nagreed. MR. DICKEY pointed out that the present draft would not rule\nout the International Chamber of Commerce in which they were par-\nticularly interested. He thought the consultants would accept the\nproposal and he would undertake to present it to them in its best\nlight. General agreement was then reached that the text as proposed\nby Mr. Stinebower was acceptable.\n  CALLING OF CONFERENCE BY THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL\n  MR. STINEBOWER noted that the Soviet Union objected to the Eco-\nnomic and Social Council being empowered to call conferences and\n  50 Draft entitled "Committee 11/3, Economic and Social Cooperation:\nRecom-\nmendations of the U.S. Advisers Based on Proposals of U.S. Consultants"\n(U.S.\nGen. 131), not printed.\n829\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0891&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0891&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0891&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0891&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0891&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0891&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0891&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0890&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0892&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0890&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0892&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0891&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
