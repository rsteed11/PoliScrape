Mr. Molotov said to accede to the request would\nnot be a bad thing, and that it might be discussed in the Steering\nCommittee. The Secretary pointed out that the request was to serve\nin an advisory capacity to the Conference as a whole. Mr. Molotov\nsaid that the Soviet Delegation has already expressed to the World\nTrade Union Conference its approval of its request and that therefore\nanything other than favorable action to it would be embarrassing\nto the Soviet Delegation. Mr. Eden pointed out that the request was\npresented before the four sponsors and that if the sponsors- are not\nin agreement in the matter it would presumably be necessary to report\nthe fact to the Steering Committee. Mr. Molotov approved, and all\nagreed that the subject should be referred to the Steering Committee.\n  Mr. Hiss stated that papers suggesting a tentative and informal\nbasis of organization and procedure of the Conference were yesterday\ncirculated to the Secretaries General of the Delegations for their con-\nsideration.16  Mr. Molotov said that it will be necessary to examine\nthem. Mr. Hiss commented that the papers as circulated contain\nonly points already agreed to between the various sponsors. Mr. Mol-\notov said that he has not seen the papers and must withhold his posi-\ntion until he has had time to examine them. He asked further whether,\namong these papers, the agenda for the meeting of the April 26 Meet-\ning of the Heads of Delegations is included, and Mr. Hiss replied in\nthe affirmative. Copies were thereupon distributed among those pres-\nent. Mr. Molotov asked what is contemplated under point 4 of the\nproposed agenda (i.e., Nomination of the presiding officer or officers\nof the Conference). Mr. Hiss replied that the inclusion of this item\nin the Secretariat's paper is simply to propose that the subject be\nlaid before the Meeting of the Heads of Delegations, and that the re-\nsultant action would, of course, depend on the decision of that meeting.\n  Mr. Molotov asked for an explanation of point 7. Mr. Hiss replied\nthat when invitations to the San Francisco Conference were sent out\nthe comments of the invited countries upon the Dumbarton Oaks\nProposals as supplemented at the Crimea Conference were invited;\nand that such comments submitted in response to that invitation 17\nwould logically be considered by the Conference.\n  Mr. Molotov asked if he might add one point to the agenda. He\nproposed that the question of invitations to the White Russian Soviet\nSocialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic be point\n9 of the agenda. He stated that he must reserve the right to raise the\nquestion of the Yalta Agreement on the subject.\n  Mr. Eden stated that while he understands the Soviet Union's goal\nin the matter, he would appreciate enlightenment as to how Mr. Mol-\neDoe. 25, DO/1, April 23, UNCIO Documents, vol. 5, p. 3.\n'Ibid., vol. 3, Dumbarton Oaks Proposals: Comments and Proposed Amend-\nments.\n405\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0467&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0467&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0467&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0467&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0467&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0467&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0467&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0466&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0468&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0466&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0468&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0467&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
