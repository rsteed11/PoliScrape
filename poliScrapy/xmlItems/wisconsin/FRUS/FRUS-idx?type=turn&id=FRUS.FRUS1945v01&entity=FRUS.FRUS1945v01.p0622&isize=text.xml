MR. PASVOLSKY replied that he had\nno objection in principle to the word "equal", but was merely point-\ning out that it would be difficult to negotiate in this connection.\nHaving gotten agreement on the Soviet proposal he was afraid we\nmight lose what we had if we started monkeying with the language.\n  ToE SECRETARY stated that he thought it was a very small request to\nask for the inclusion in the document of a reference to "equal rights\nfor\nindividuals and nations". MR. PASVOLSKY replied that the difficulty\nwith this proposal was that it raised the whole minority question.\nREPRESENTATIVE BLOOM noted that he did not recognize minorities\nand that this was the whole point of his amendment.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY reaffirmed that it had already been agreed in Chap-\nter I to take care of what Representative Bloom wanted, but that\nin addition, if it was desired to include a reference to equal rights,\nthen the matter would have to be considered.\n  THE SECRETARY asked that, if possible, a provision on equal rights\nbe included and that Mr. Sandifer should make a report on this prob-\nlem. MIR. STASSEN expressed support for the Secretary\'s statement.\nTHE SECRETARY suggested that the reference to equal rights might\nwell be included in the preamble. MR. PASVOLSKY agreed that it\nmight be possible to work lit in there.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said she would like to go on record as saying\nhow grateful she was to- find the great advance in language indicated\nin the Soviet proposal for paragraph 3 of Chapter I.\n     STATUS OF AMENDMENTS MADE BY THE FOUR GOVERNMENTS\n  MR. PASVOLS1KY thought that it might be necessary, if agreement\nwas not reached on the Vandenberg proposal,73 for us to put forward\nthat proposal separately. He added that the British and even the\nRussians might have one or two individual proposals to make. SENA-\nTOR CONNALLY remarked that this question would, for the moment,\nhave to be reserved. THE SECRETARY pointed out to Mr. Notter that it\nwould not be possible for Mr. Stassen or anyone else to discuss this with\nthe press until a policy had been established in consultation with the\nfour sponsoring governments. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE thought that, if\njoint proposals of the four governments were issued, the impression\nmight be given that the four governments were ganging up on the\nother countries. MR. PASVOLSKiY thought it would be possible to make\nan introductory statement to the effect that these proposals were the re-\nsult of our joint studies, but that we were ready to consider all the\nviews and proposals presented by other governments.\n  \'3 For previous discussion of chapter V, section B, paragraph 6, see minutes\nof\nmeeting of the United States delegation, May 2, 5: 30 p. m., pp. 528, 537;\nfor text\nof United States proposal, see Postwar Foreign Policy Preparation, p. 680.\n560\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0622&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0622&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0622&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0622&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0622&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0622&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0622&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0621&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0623&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0621&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0623&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0622&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
