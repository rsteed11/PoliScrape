The amendment was strongly\nsupported without a dissenting voice by govt employer and labor\nspeakers including the British Govt delegate. American employer\nand labor delegates concurred.\n  Goodrich speaking for US Govt stated that he had no instructions\n-on this point. He pointed out that if any attempt should ever be\nmade, in case the proposed amendment was accepted, to change the\nILO Constitution without the consent of the US in such way as to\neffect US rights under the US Constitution such an attempt would\nbe likely to result in American withdrawal from the ILO. He as-\nsumed that no such attempt would be made. He therefore would not\noppose the Forbes-Watson amendment but neither could he support it.\n  Thereupon, Phelan 45 in line with Forbes-Watson motion withdrew\nthe passage quoted above and article 13 was voted as follows "amend-\nments to this constitution which are adopted by the Conference by a\nmajority of two-thirds of the votes cast by the delegates present shall\ntake effect when ratified or accepted by two-thirds of the members of\nthe organization including five of the eight members which are rep-\nresented on the Governing Body as members of chief industrial im-\nportance in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article\n17 of this constitution"\n  In case the Dept should object to the stand taken by Goodrich, the\nmatter could be reopened in Plenary Session when the report of the\nConstitutional Committee is submitted but such a course would cause\nsubstantial difficulties and the US delegate would be likely to find\nhimself almost completely isolated. We do not propose to make any\nfurther move in this matter unless instructed by the Dept. [ILO\ndelegation.]\n                                                         CAFEY\n50.C115 Paris/10-2645: Telegram\n   The Secretary of State to the Ambas8ador in France (Caffery)\n                           WASHINGTON, November 1, 1945-6 p. m.\n  5100.
