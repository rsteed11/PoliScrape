General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 450\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nin its present form it incorporated full safeguards with respect to\nareas essential to our security.\n  Senator Connally inquired whether there were any reservations\nwith respect to the proposal on the part of the Army and Navy. Gov-\nernor Stassen pointed out that the three amendments offered by the\nArmy and Navy had been accepted and would be incorporated in the\ndraft.\n  Mr. Gates explained that the Army and the Navy were in agree-\nment with the proposal if the three small changes suggested were\nmade. Since they had been accepted on that basis he could say that\nthe plan would be acceptable to the Army and Navy.\n  Senator Connally inquired whether this statement ought not to be\ninterpreted as meaning that the Army and Navy were accepting this\nproposal because they were unable to do anything better.\n  Mr. Gates replied- that the Army and Navy would prefer that the\nsubject not be discussed at this time but that if for political or other\nreasons it had to be discussed at this time the proposal was acceptable.\n  Governor Stassen pointed out that this position would be going\nbehind the policy clearly fixed by the President.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky gave reassurance that the draft proposal was en-\ntirely within the framework of the President's directive.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky went on to inform the Delegation that the question\nof trusteeship had come up in the Steering Committee at its meeting\nthis morning 81 and that the heads of two of the delegations had raised\nthe question as to whether trusteeship would be discussed and had\nsuggested that there would be trouble if it were not discussed. They\nalso intimated that it would be unacceptable to try to pin the discus-\nsion down exclusively to the security question. Mr. Pasvolsky stated\nthat he did not know what the reaction of the- other governments would\nbe to this paper, but that he would like to recommend it as a basis for\ndiscussion. This recommendation was accepted and the paper was\napproved.\n  Governor Stassen stated the feeling that the technical experts and\nadvisers who had worked on the trusteeship subject had done a fine\njob on an extremely difficult subject. He considered the report a sig-\nnificant contribution to the Charter of the Organization.\n  Senator Connally observed that a motion had been made to approve\nthe document and inquired whether it was satisfactory to Dr. Bowman.\nDr. Bowman replied that he accepted it.\n  Senator Connally stated that it had been suggested during the after-\nnoon that he should be on the negotiating committee for this document,\nbut that he would like to renege. Senator Connally inquired of Gov-\nernor Stassen whether he would like to substitute for him.
