He added that it would be well to have Chief Justice\nStone\'s point of view. SENATOR CONNALLY suggested that former\nChief Justice Hughes might also be consulted.32  It was then gen-\nerally agreed that the Delegation would reserve its position and that\nformer Chief Justice Hughes and Chief Justice Stone would be\nconsulted.\n  MR. HACKWORTH said he had a further point to raise-the question\nof                    ction.33 He explained that some countries\nwanted compulsory jurisdiction, but that the United Kingdom and the\nSoviet Union were opposed.34  Among those countries favoring com-\npulsory jurisdiction in particular were the Latin American countries.\nSENATOR CONNALLY said that he could not agree to compulsory juris-\ndiction unless the cases that could come before the Court were very\nrestricted.\n  MR. HAOKWORTH explained that the American Bar Association was\nvery much in favor of compulsory jurisdiction and that they would\nlike to see compulsory jurisdiction adopted. They recognized, how-\never, that it would be necessary to permit any government to make a\nreservation when approving the treaty. SENATOR VANDENBERG com-\nmented that the Permanent Court did not get by the $enate, even\nwith its present jurisdiction. MR.

HACKWORTH agreed that it was possible to have\ncompulsory jurisdiction under the present statute.\n  THE SECRETARY said it was then agreed that this government did\nnot favor the proposals of the Latin American countries for compul-\nsory Jurisdiction.\n  MR. HACKWORTH explained that a third point he wished to discuss\nwas that of advisory opinions.35 He noted that the Dumbarton Oaks\nProposals pr~ovi-ithat the Security Council may ask for advisory\nopinions but that there was now some feeling that both the Assembly\nand other international organizations should also be allowed to ask\nfor advisory opinions. SENATOR CONNALLY said he had no particular\n32 In accordance with the request of the United States delegation, the views\nof Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone and former Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes\n(appointed in 1930 and retired in 1941) were obtained.
