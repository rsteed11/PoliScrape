HACKWORTH pointed out that whether a new court or an old court\nwere accepted it would still be necessary to elect new judges, as the\npresent incumbents were hold-overs from 1939. REPRESENTATIVE\nEATON commented that in any event the court would be new to that\nextent.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY stated that Judge Hudson had asked him to\nbe permitted to come to a delegation meeting as a representative of\nthe court. MR. HACKWORTH commented that the court now had three\nrepresentatives in San Francisco: Judge Hudson; the President of\nthe Court, Sr. Guerrero, of El Salvador; and the Registrar,35 who\nwere representing the Court, as one of the organizations authorized\nto have representatives at the Conference. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE re-\nmarked that two or three of the Delegates had agreed to meet with\nthe representatives of the ILO and wondered if the same procedure\ncould not be followed with respect to the representatives of the Court.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said he understood that the American Bar\nAssociation was on one side and the Lawyers Guild on the other, with\nrespect to continuing the court. MR. HACKWORTH said that the Amer-\nican Bar Association wanted to retain the old court, while the Lawyers\nGuild wanted a new court. He personally thought it would be pos-\nsible to have either court, although there would be some difficulty in\ntaking the old court out of its present group and putting it into the\nUnited Nations. SENATOR CONNALLY stated that if the present court\nwere retained, it would have to be modified somewhat. SENATOR CON-\nNALLY then asked that Commander Stassen be sent for, as he hated\nto arrive at any decisions on this matter, since Commander Stassen\nwas assigned to Commission IV.\n  DR. PASVOLSKY then introduced the following Brazilian proposal\nwith respect to the power of the court to review treaties: 36\n  "Where any Contracting Party of an executory treaty alleges that\nit can not be carried out, either partially or totally, or that it is unjust\nto maintain its existence, the Assembly, by a majority of two thirds,\nmay invite the other, or other Contracting Parties to agree with the\nfirst as to the revision or annulment of such treaty. Should one of\nthe Contracting Parties not agree to the revision or annulment, the\nother or other Contracting Parties shall be authorized to have recourse\nto the Permanent Court of International Justice which, by a declara-\ntory verdict, shall decide whether the treaty in question has partially\nor totally lost its binding force in consequence of changes in the con-\nditions which brought about the treaty, or because it has become\nunfairly burdensome for one or more of the Contracting Parties."\nDR. PASVOLSKY commented that this proposal would amount to com-\npulsory jurisdiction in this type of case.\n35J.
