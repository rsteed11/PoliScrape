He said\nthat on March 13 Ambassador Harriman had addressed a note to M1r.\nMolotov in which he informed him that the United States Govern-\nment desired to initiate consultations prior to the San Francisco Con-\nference on the subject of trusteeship and that the consultations would\ntake place in Washington as early as possible but not before April 1.9\nHe said that since then the Soviet Government had heard nothing fur-\nther on the subject and desired any information we might be able to\ngive him. Mr. Harriman\'s note had also stated that documents would\nbe forthcoming with respect to this subject.\n  I reminded the Ambassador that we had heard nothing from the\nSoviet Government in response to this invitation although the other\ngovernments who were informed at the same time, that is, the British,\nChinese, and French Governments 90 have already designated their\nrepresentatives who will deal with this subject in Washington.\n  I told the Ambassador that we had not made any definite arrange-\nments as yet with regard to the consultations he referred to and that\nwe hoped within a few days to be able to give him further informa-\ntion on the subject. I said that as far as the documents were con-\ncerned that no paper had been given to us by any of the governments\nwith whom we had taken the matter up or had se presented documents\non the subject to any of those governments. I said we still expected\nto have consultations on the matter prior to the San Francisco Con-\nference and that as soon as our arrangements were made we would\nbe very happy to notify the Soviet Government accordingly. I fur-\nther explained that this was a matter which had been caused some\ndelay by the death of President Roosevelt as it was a question which\nwas being discussed with him at the time of his death. The Ambassa-\ndor thanked me very much for this information and said he would\nawait a further communication.\n                                            JAMES CLEMENT DuNN\n  9 See telegram 2049, March i1, midnight, to London (repeated to Moscow\nand\nChungking), concerning the Department\'s proposed procedure for holding con-\nsultations on trusteeship, p. 128.\n9\' A memorandum of conversation by the Director of the Office of Special\nPo-\nlitical Affairs (Hiss) on April 16 noted that both Jacques Fouques-Duparc\nand\nEtienne Dennery, of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "stated\nthat they\nwished to emphasize that they thought it would be helpful if the five-power\ntalks\non trusteeship which had been envisaged for Washington, which appeared now\ncould not be held before the San Francisco Conference, could be held in San\nFrancisco before any meeting of the proposed Trusteeship Committee of Com-\nmission II of the Conference."\n     723-91-G67  23\n295\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
