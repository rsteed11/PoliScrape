We\ncould then say that a meeting would be called to bring the Act of\nChapultepec into harmony with the General Organization. ThE\nSECRETARY thought there might be some value in the suggestion and\nasked the advice -of General Embick. GENERAL EMBICK thought there\nwas some value in this approach believing that what the Latin Ameri-\ncans wanted was to have a meeting at which a treaty could be\nprepared.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked whether the Latin Americans would turn\ndown our compromise altogether unless they had this assurance by\nthe President. SENATOR VANDENBERG replied in the negative indicat-\ninrg that they had not asked for this proposal. THE SECRETARY indi-\ncated that he was not in favor of the draft memorandum as it stood.\nMR. ROCKEFELLER explained that when he had proposed the omission\nof reference to the Act of Chapultepec the necessity had been created\nof searching for an alternative to satisfy the Latin Americans. In\nlooking for this alternative this memorandum had been worked out.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY pointed out that the Charter envisages regional\norganizations that could have plenty of authority. The only thing is\nthat enforcement action would have to be approved by the Security\nCouncil. SENATOR VANDENBERG noted that the Latin Americans\nwanted to have a regional organization that could take enforcement\naction without approval. THE SECRETARY stated that this was im-\npossible.\n  Mit. STASSEN moved the first three items of the Secretary's recom-\nniendation, a, b, and c and urged that a vote be taken. THE SECRE-\nTARY polled the Delegation and all agreed to the motion. SENATOR\n'VANDENBERG pointed out that these items alone would no1 work as we\nwould have to provide the Latin Americans with something to go\n-home with in -the way of a word of assurance to their peoples.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER stated that, once the policy was settled, he and Mr.\nDunn would prepare and bring back to the Delegation a proposal to\nimplement that policy.\n    ,~~~~              e wa op\n  THE SECRETARY said he was opposed to the President proclaiming\nduring the San Francisco Conference that a meeting of the hemisphere\nwould be called. SENATOR VAi-DENBERG and SENATOR CONN ALLY\nagreed that this would overdo the matter and THE SECRETARY pointed\nout that there was already a lot of damage to repair.\n   SENATOR CONNALLY asked whether the Latin Americans really\ntrusted us. MR. DULLES pointed out that the language of the Act\nof Chapultepec to the effect that the governments of the American\n&gt;epublics should consider the conclusion of a treaty raised the ques-\ntion whether this Government was now favorable to or looked with\ndisfavor on such a treaty. MR.
