General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 520\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nwould apply in all cases except: (1) matters of procedure and (2)\ninvestigatory matters, when one of the five powers is a party to the\ndispute, in which event that state would not have a veto. DR. PAS-\nVOLSKY stated that Commander Stassen\'s analysis was correct.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY noted that a number of proposals had been\nadvanced with regard to Chapter VIII, although the United States\nhad only proposed several unimportant amendments. He wondered\nwhat some of the issues, with respect to the Security Council, were\ngoing to be. DR. PASVOLSKY observed that the delegation was waiting\nto receive the papers containing the foreign proposals from the Secre-\ntariat. SENATOR CONNALLY said it seemed to him that Chapter VIII\nwas going to be fairly simple. DR. PASVOLSKY observed that a lot of\nproposals were being made with respect to Chapter VIII. MR. DULLES\nstated that there was pressure to shift the second paragraph of Chap-\nter VIII, Section B into Chapter VIII, Section A, so that a state\ncould be branded as an aggressor by the Security Council without\nthe application of the veto power of the five great states. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG asked if this would not override the Yalta decision. MR.\nDULLES stated that the small powers were willing to accept the veto of\nthe great powers over decisions of action, but not over the power to\nbrand a country as an aggressor. DR. PASVOLSKY commented that\nthe French Delegation was moving to have all of Section A of Chap-\nter VIII declared- procedural. MR. DULLES stated that according to\nthe Yalta Agreement," the unanimous vote of the five great powers\nwould be necessary for action by the Security Council under Chapter\nVIII, Section B. Section B contains the provision by which a great\npower would be labeled an aggressor; and it was this provision that\nthe small powers wanted shifted into Section A. SENATOR VANDEN-\nBERG again asked if that change would conflict with the Yalta agree-\nment. DR. PASVOLSKY thought this proposal would have to be con-\nsidered jointly by the four sponsoring powers.\nREFERENCE OF JUSTICIABLE DISPUTES TO THE INTERNATIONAL COURT\n  MR. DULLES asked the Delegation to go back to the question of the\nlanguage of Chapter VIII, Section A, paragraph 6. MR. HAcK-\nWORTH read his proposed amendments to this paragraph again: "6.\nDisputes which are susceptible of judicial determination should nor-\nmally be referred to the International Court of Justice...." MR.\nDULLES asked if that provision were intended to alter the status of the\nparties to the world court. MR. HACKWORTH replied that a case could\nbe referred to the court by agreement of parties. MR. DULLES ob-\nserved that this language does not say that, but rather gives the Secu-\nrity Council power to refer cases to the court. COMMANDER STASSEN\nagreed. MR. FAHY proposed that this language should make refer-\n" Conferences at Malta and Yalta, p. 976.\n520\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0582&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0582&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0582&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0582&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0582&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0582&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0582&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0581&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0583&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0581&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0583&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0582&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
