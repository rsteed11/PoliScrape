SENATOR CONNALLY observed that it\nwas essential to have unity among the Big Five on this question.\nRecommendation (c) was approved.\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON brought to the attention of the Delegation\nthe question being raised in Committee 1/2 concerning the amend-\nment to Chapter IV, providing for representation and participation\nin the organs of the International Organization of men and women\nunder the same conditions.51 He stated that there were four ladies in\nthe Committee who were pressing very hard for this amendment and\nthat it had strong support. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM stated that the\nsame question had arisen in Committee II/1 52 and inquired what the\nrecommendation of the Delegation was with respect to the jurisdic-\ntion of the respective Committees. MR. PASVOLSKY stated that the\nquestion of jurisdiction would have to be decided between the Presi-\ndents of the Commissions. MR. SANDIFER referred to the recommen-\ndations in US Gen 112 concerning the election of the Secretary General\nand the question of representation of women on which recommenda-\ntions were made in items (a) and (c) respectively.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY read item (a) concerning the recommendations on\nthe method of selection of the Deputy Secretaries-General, the number\nto be elected, their term of office and their eligibility for reelection.\nMR. PAsvOIJsKY pointed out that the amendment of the Sponsoring\nGovernments 53 answered all but one of these points, namely the eligi-\nbility of the Deputy Secretaries-General for reelection. REPRESENTA-\nTIVE BLOOM inquired whether the Deputies should be nominated by\nthe Council and elected by the Assembly. He stated that Canada was\nproposing that the Secretary-General appoint the Deputies.54 MR.\nNorrm suggested that we might have more than four Deputies to\nmeet the criticism that both the Secretary-General and the four Depu-\nties would probably all be nationals of the Great Powers. THE SECRE-\nTARY stated his firm belief that the agreement with the Big Four\non the amendments should be observed unless there is very good reason\nfor departing from it.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM then inquired whether it would be possible\nto make a compromise in connection with the system of election pro-\nposed by the Sponsoring Governments. He wondered whether we,\nshould go along to defeat on this question or whether we should\'\ncompromise and save something of our position. MR. DurLLEs ob-\nserved that it would be unfortunate if the Five Powers could not\naccomplish what they want. MR. PA5VOLSKY recommended that the\nquestion of the re-eligibility of the Deputies be raised with the Com-\n61 Doc. 357, I/2/19, May 16, UNCIO Documents, vol. 7, p. 43.\n"2Doc. 294, II/1/10, May 14, ibid., vol. 8, p. 324.\n\'m Doc. 2, G/29, May 5, ibid., vol. 3, p. 627.\n"Doc. 2, G/14(t), May 6, ibid., p. 595.\n755\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0816&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0816&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
