General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 335\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON felt that the attitude with which this whole\nmatter should be approached was that we were at the beginning of a\ngreat world development, that this was only a first step, a beginning,\nand that it would be essential to make changes. SENATOR CONNALLY\nindicated that his main objection to the proposal was the setting of a\ndefinite time for the convening of a convention. Such a provision, he\nsaid, would simply announce to the world that we are establishing a\ntemporary outfit. SENATOR CONNALLY thought that the calling of a\ngeneral convention should be left up to an agency of the Organization\nto call it by a special vote.\n  DR. BOWMAN indicated that there was a very practical political\nproblem to be met since there would inevitably be strong objections to\ncertain provisions of the Charter. He thought the addition now of a\nprovision for periodic revision would decrease the pressure of public\nopinion.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY said that Mr. Pasvolsky had meiAtioned that\nthis question was discussed at Dumbarton Oaks. THE SENATOR ques-\ntioned how strong the opposition to this proposal had been. MR.\nPAsvoLsKY replied that the opposition had been very heavy, but that\nthere might have been some change of opinion in view of the discus-\nsions subsequent to Dumbarton Oaks. MR. DiJLLES thought it would\nbe very useful to be able to say that the Charter was no the last word,\nthat it was just a start and so that people could have hope that at\nsome \'future date changes might be made. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE\nthought that the amendment process should if possible be liberalized\nand that this proposal was one way of doing it. She added that she\nsaw the difficulty pointed out by Senator Connally of specifying a\ndate at which time a General Convention should be called.\n  MR. STAS&amp;EN suggested that his proposal might be redrafted to\nread "A Revisionary Convention of the Members of the United Na-\ntions may be held by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly for\nthe purpose of revising the Charter, at a date and place to be deter-\nmined by the General Assembly. Any revisions proposed would take\neffect upon ratification in accordance with their respective constitu-\ntional purposes of two-thirds of the Members including the per-\nmanent Members of the Security Councill." MR. PASVOLSKY pointed\nout that the special position given to the permanent Members in\nthis procedure followed logically from their special responsibilities\nfor security matters.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY wondered why the whole matter was not left to\nthe Assembly. SENATOR VANDENBERG pointed out that this country\nwould not have a veto in the General Assembly. MR. DuLums noted\nthat if Mr. Stassen\'s suggestions were adopted, this country would\nhave a veto over any revision proposed by the Conference, but that it\nwould not have a veto over the calling of the Conference.
