MR.\nHACKWORTH observed that under the mandates system only the League\ncould change the terms of a mandate. In reply to a question whether\nthe mandatory power had a veto, COMMANDER STASSEN replied in the\nnegative. MR. HACKWORTH stated that under the mandate treaties no\nchange in the terms of the mandate could be made without the consent\nof the League and the United States. COMMANDER STASSEN said that\nunder this provision the terms of the mandates could not be changed\nwithout the consent of the mandatory power. MR. GERIG stated that\nthe question of the transfer of a mandate was, however, a contested\npoint under the League. COMMANDER STASSEN replied that, as a prac-\ntical matter, it would not be possible to transfer a mandate without\nthe consent of the mandatory power.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN stated that the addition to paragraph 5 "made\nunder paragraph 6 below" was inserted to make it perfectly clear\nthat the agreements to be concluded subsequently would control.\n  In connection with the addition to paragraph 7 "without prejudice\nto any special agreement made under Chapter VIII, Section B, para-\ngraph 5", COMMANDER STASSEN stated that this had been made because\nthe Soviets feared that the provision as it stood might affect the forces\nand facilities to be supplied the Security Council.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN explained the additions made to paragraph 11\nconcerning the composition of a Trusteeship Council and said that this\ntook care of the Soviet request for a seat on the Council. MR. NorTER\ninquired whether any members of the Trusteeship Council would have\na veto to which COMMANDER STASSEN replied in the negative. MR.\nGERIG pointed out that there was no reference to the majority which\nwould be required for decisions of the Trusteeship Council. MR.\nPAsvOLsKY expressed the view that a two-thirds majority would be\nsafer than a simple majority in order to protect the administering\npowers. If there were only a simple majority the administering pow-\ners would be in a, minority. COMMANDER STASSEN stated that he would\nraise this question and seek to get agreement on a two-thirds majority.\nMR. GATEs thought that the whole document was quite satisfactory\nand believed that the two-thirds majority vote was acceptable. COM-\nMANDER STASSEN suggested that the word "shall" be substituted for\nthe word "may" in the last sentence of paragraph 11.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN pointed out that the addition to paragraph 13\n"on the political, economic, and social advancement of the inhabitants\nof the territory" had been suggested by the British and had conse-\nquently been incorporated in this draft. THE SECRETARY, after noting\nthat the Delegation agreed to this revised document, extended con-\ngratulations to Commander Stassen.
