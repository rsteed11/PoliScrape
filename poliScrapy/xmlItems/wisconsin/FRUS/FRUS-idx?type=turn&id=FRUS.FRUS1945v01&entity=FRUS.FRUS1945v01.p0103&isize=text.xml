General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 41\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENUE\nprinciples of International Law and that he at that time raised the\nquestion, if it were not, why the American republics had accepted\nand adhered to this principle. He said that it was then that Dr.\nPasvolsky had agreed it would be convenient to include this phrase\nin the Proposal in some way.\nTHE AMBASSADOR- OF CHILE agreed with. the remarks of the Ambas-\nsador of Honduras but stated that he had not at the time agreed that\nthe principle of "respect for international treaties" was included\nin\nthe rules of international law, in as much as international law, not\nyet being clearly defined, could hardly be said to comprise this\nprinciple.\n  THE AMBASSADOR OF VENEZUELA called attention to a correction- to\nbe made on page 6 of the minutes of January 26. He stated that\nhe did not recall having brought up the question of unanimity\nand believed this remark had been incorrectly attributed to\nhim. With these corrections, the minutes of the last meeting were\napproved.\n  Discussion of. the Proposals then began with Chapter VI. DR.\nPASVOLsEY referred to Section A on the composition of the Security\nCouncil remarking that several points had been brought out in the\ncommentaries regarding the size of the Council, the number of perma-\nnent seats, and specific provisions for representation. He said that\nas regards the composition of the Council, two broad considerations\nmust be taken into account: The Council must be efficient and effective,\nand it must be representative. He stated that the provision for perma-\nnent seats on the Council was related to the responsibilities in the per-\nformance of its principal functions, and was conditioned upon the\nability and willingness of the powers who did have permanent seats\nto carry out the heavy responsibilities that would rest upon them.\nHe said that the provision for the five countries specified as perma-\nnent members was related to the fact that those countries now repre-\nsented the preponderance of military and industrial power in the\nworld.\n  With reference to the number of nonpermanent states, DR. PASVOL-\nsfxy spoke of the original Council of the League of Nations, which\nhad five permanent and four nonpermanent members at its inception,\na total of nine which gradually increased until just before the war\nthere were fifteen members on the Council. He explained that at the\nDumbarton Oaks discussions it was concluded that one point must\nbe established at the very start: The Council must have more nonper-\nmanent than permanent members in order to avoid a situation in which\na decision of the Council could be taken solely by the votes of the\npermanent members.83 He stressed the points that the selection of\n\' See memorandum by the Under Secretary of State (Stettinius) to President\nRoosevelt, August 28, 1944, Foreign Relations, 1944, vol.
