REPRE-\nSENTATIVE BLoOM declared that he had no strong opinion one way or\nthe other and that he understood everyone's desires.\n  MR. DUNN suggested that the phraseology of Paragraph 8 of the\nTrusteeship Chapter should be changed so that the maintenance of\nthe status quo -would be mandatory and so that the paragraph would\nnot constitute an exception to the general principle laid down. REP-\nRESENTATIVE BLOOM remarked, however, that an exception had al-\nready been made in the White Paper. COMMANDER STA$SEN declared\nthat if the Delegation were agreed that the special clause should be\nincluded in the Charter it might open up questions related to other\nterritories. MR. DUNN declared that he thought the wording should\nbe changed to get away from the exception established. He sug-\ngested that it be made mandatory that the trusteeship arrangements\nmaintain the existing situation.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM declared that the Arabs were not fools and\nwould construe any phraseology according to their own interests.\nCOMMANDER STASSEN urged once more that if the United States was\nwilling to assure both the Jews and the Arabs that the trusteeship ar-\nrangements would insure carrying over the League situation the\nwhole matter could be separated from the Charter. MR. DUNN re-\nmarked that this should not be a unilateral affair and that the other\ninterested governments should also sponsor the assurance. REPRE-\nSENTATIVE 'BLOOM was of the opinion that no mention of either the\nJews or the Arabs should be included in the Charter. He replied to\nthe suggestion that the matter should be taken up with Jewish lead-\ners by pointing out that there were two opposing factions and that\nsome of the chief leaders had already left San Francisco. No steps\ncould be taken without full agreement. MR. D-uNN asked what should\nbe done about the exception established and urged that it would raise\nobjections from both sides. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM remarked that\nhe was opposed to changing the idea of the mandate and was just\ntrying to keep out of trouble.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN observed that this was essentially a problem\nof the political relationship of the United States to the Arabs, and\nhe thought that someone from the State Department should see the\nArab groups. MR. DUNN wondered what position the Britishand\nRussians would take on this issue, and REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM replied\nthat it was the British who were the important factor. He went on\nto shy thattheImattner was still open because it had'been agreed in the\nCommittee on Trusteeship that the' Iraqi representative should be\npermitted to present his case. COMMANDER STASSEN indicated that\nhe was sure that he would be able to outvote any -amendments pro-\nposed by Iraq.
