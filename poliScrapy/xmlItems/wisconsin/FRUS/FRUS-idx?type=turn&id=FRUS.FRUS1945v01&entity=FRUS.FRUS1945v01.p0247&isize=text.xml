General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 185\n\n\nUNlTED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nsaid the Government is not free to do other than to support the Soviet\nproposal.\n  In answer to SENATOR VANDENBERG\'S inquiry he was informed that\nwe do not feel thatthis violates sovereign equality. THE SECRETARY\nadded that he felt that if an individual delegate disagreed with this\ncommitment that he should feel free to make a public statement on it.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY said he felt we must go along with the ,com-\nmitment which had been made. He indicated that he regrets that\nit had been made and personally doesn\'t like it but feels he must go\nalong as a representative of this Government at, this Conference.\nSENATOR VANDENBERG commented that it appeared to him that the\nDelegation had been told one thing and the public another. SENATOR\nCONNALLY then reviewed his recollection of what had been told the\nDelegation and REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM expressed his agreement with\nthe recital. The essence was that the Delegation had been told what\nhad been agreed to at Yalta and that the President had indicated\nthat he would support this at San FranciscoJ if he were present.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG indicated that we were acting somewhat in\nthe boy scout manner by in effect surrendering to a Soviet demand\nand then giving up our rights in the matter.\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON stressed the importance of the meeting at\nSan Francisco and mentioned the tendency of our people to magnify\nminor events, intimating that the press was playing up this matter\nout of its proper proportion. He pleaded that we must make a begin-\nning at San Francisco for -a new world order based on justice, law\nand order rather than on brute strength. He said that this was our\ntest, "Can we unite to create this new world -order and if \'we cannot\nwhat is the use of being a human being?  He said he had been\nwaiting for the opportunity of being present at San Francisco for\nforty years and that a beginning of the new world must be made\nat that meeting. He repeated that this must be based on a world\norder resting on justice.\n  In reply to the Secretary\'s inquiries REPRESENTATVE EATON ex-\npressed the opinion that the statement was as good as could be written\nunder the circumstances. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE expressed the view that\nit was fairly good, possibly as good as could be drawn up, but that\nshe would like to see in it some strong statement along the line of\nthat just made by Representative Eaton which would give a lift to\nour people who are badly confused as a result of the present situa-\ntion. She indicated that she felt the members of the Delegation as\nindividuals were free, and that if one of them should feel strongly\nin opposition on some question he should be free to so state publicly\nbut that as a Delegation we are bound to support the commitment.\n185\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0247&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0247&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0247&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0247&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0247&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0247&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0247&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0246&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0248&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0246&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0248&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0247&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
