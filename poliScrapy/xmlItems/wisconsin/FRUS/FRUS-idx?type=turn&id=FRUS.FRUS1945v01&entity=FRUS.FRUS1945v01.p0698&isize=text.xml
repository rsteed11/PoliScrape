More-\nover, there is the obligation, after the establishment of peace, to con-\nsider the conclusion of a treaty under which the wartime obligations\nwould be assumed in perpetuity. Very important, however, was the\nfact stated in Chapter III of the Act of Chapultepec that the opera-\ntion of the Act shall be in conformity with the purposes and prin-\nciples of the Organization, when that Organization is set up.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER stated that he tended to agree with Mr. Pas-\nvolsky\'s statement and that it was interesting to note that the ini-\ntiative for the Act of Chapultepec had come from Mr. Roosevelt,\nwho had proposed to the Colombians that they propose a resolu-\ntion for the mutual guarantee of borders in this hemisphere.33  MR.\nROOSEVELT had said he would tell the Chinese and the Russians that\nthis is what we intended to do. MR. ROCKEFELLER explained that the\nLatin Americans had no desire to withdraw from the World Organi-\nzation and wanted to play their part fully. He thought that if Mr.\nPasvolsky\'s suggestion was adopted we would be able to move for-\nward happily with the Latin Americans.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY pointed out that there were three items not thor-\noughly considered in connection with the Act of Chapultepec:\n  (1) We never considered whether under this system we committed\nall of our forces or only a part of our forces.\n  (2) We never faced the question as to the kind of procedures by\nwhich our forces would be set in motion.\n  (3) Action could be taken, not only if a certain event took place, but\nalso if there was suspiciOn of such an event, and we have not clarified\nour interpretation of intervention.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG stated that the problem was that we would be\nhelpless to act in the new world if our action was not wanted by China\nor Russia. AMI. PAsvoLsKY noted that thanks to our own veto power\nno state could interfere in this hemisphere. In the event of an attack\nupon us from within or without, we would go to the Security Council,\nand if the Security Council refused to act, we would take action in\nself-defense. There was no question, he said, but that if our security\nwas immediately imperiled by the failure of the Organization to act,\nwe would ourselves act.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said this amounted to doing as we pleased.\nAIR. PASVOLSEKY pointed out that we would do as we pleased only if\nwe were attacked and the council would not act.
