BYING-\nTON said he had immediately given out a denial and he said there had\nbeen no foundation whatever for the report....\n                  STATEMENTS BY CONSULTANTS\n  THE SECRETARY said that before the Delegation started discussing\nthe amendments the United States should bring up in the meeting of\nthe Sponsoring Governments tonight, he wanted to report on the meet-\ning of the Consultants.58 He thought it had been an excellent meet-\ning and he had been deeply impressed by the discussion. The Con-\nsultants had shown themselves especially concerned about the expan-\nsion of the reference to human rights and fundamental freedoms. He\nhad called their attention to the phrase in Chapter IX of the Dumbar-\nton Oaks Proposals on promoting respect for human rights and funda-\nmental freedoms. MR. HACKWORTH interjected the reminder that it\nwas now proposed to add such a reference to Chapter I. THE SEC-\nRETARY said that at the Consultants' meeting Mr. Nolde, Mr. Pros-\nkauer59 and others had made speeches and they had presented a\nstatement signed by a considerable group.\n  THE SECRETARY read the statement regarding human rights submit-\nted to the United States Delegation by a group of Consultants repre-\nsenting church bodies, business, labor, civic organizations, etc. (U.S.\nGen 42, May 2, 1945 60). THE SECRETARY commented that the Con-\nsultants thought this a matter of tremendous importance. He had\nassured them that at Dumbarton Oaks he personally had voted for\nrecognition of human rights and fundamental freedoms and he had\npromised them that he would take up the matter of expanding and\ndefining in greater detail what the functions of the organization might\nbe in this respect. He had told them that he could not say whether\nthe Delegation would sponsor the language they proposed. The Con-\nsultants had said that they thought the United States should try to\nobtain agreement on giving much greater emphasis to human rights,\neven if there was some risk of failure. They thought that even if the\nUnited States Delegation failed in its attempt, the Delegation could\nput out a statement that it had tried and this would carry a great\nweight with American public opinion.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG commented that the group of Consultants had\nasked for four measures of which two were already included in the\nUnited States proposals. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said that while it\nwas all right to talk about human rights, he thought it would be\nbetter to refer to equal rights; that would mean more and go farther\n  5 See The Memoirs of Cordell Hull, vol.
