General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 646\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\n  THE SECRETARY asked Mr. Rockefeller what had destroyed the faith\nof the American republics in the general organization when they ar-\nrived here in San Francisco. He said it was obvious that they had\nlost their confidence in the general organization and had nowhere\nnear the genuine sincerity and interest they had previously expressed.\nAIR. ROCE.FELLER replied that the reason for this loss of faith could\nbe traced to the way the Soviet representatives had behaved toward\nthe Secretary and their actions in general, their maneuvers and the\nentirely novel type of tactics that the Latin American representatives\nhad come up against. MR. DuNN thought it was as much the attitude\n-of the Soviets toward the other American republics. SENATOR VAN-\nDENBERG felt that a new and hysterical dread was sweeping the repre-\nsentatives of the American republics. MR. MOCLOY suggested that the\ndeath of Mr. Roosevelt might explain the situation in part. MR.\nSTAssEN suggested that the President should speak out strongly on\nthe Pan American Union, and TmH SECRETARY noted that the President\nhad already made one speech which had been an excellent one.43 Ma.\nROCKEFELLER indicated that the representatives of the American re;.\npublics were coming around to the position that, until the world or-\nganization proved its effectiveness, the Western Hemisphere system\nshould be free from the necessity of any authorization for action by\nthe Security Council. MR. D-UNN noted that some of the representa-\ntives were saying that there was no, use for the international organi-\nzation. MR. STAssEN said that this was nothing moreithan a narrow\nisolationist approach and that it was exceedingly dangerous.\n  AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN stated that it was important for the Secre-\ntary not to commit us tonight but merely to make Mr. Molotov under-\nstand that this issue would certainly come up in the near future. MR.\nSTASsEN thought that the memorandum that had been prepared for\nuse by the Secretary was excellent and that the Secretary -should\ncertainly not allow Mr. Molotov to leave without raising this matter\nwith him. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE, asked whether it was true- that the\nArab delegations had told the Latin Anmericans that they would vote\nwith them. MR. ROCKEFELLER reported that the Arabs, had, offered to\nsupport the Latin Americans, giving them five votes, but that the\n*Latin Americans had refused.\n  THE SECRETARY remarked that the draft memorandum as it stood\nwas unsatisfactory and that it should be re-dictated immediately in the\nlight of the suggestions made during the discussions. SENATOR\nV-ANDENBERG- thought that we should stress that we wanted an excep-\ntion only until the organization proveA it&#167; reliability and that we\nwould\nfight to the death the right of the Soviet Union to the same privilege.\n'For address broadcast from Washington on April 25, for the opening session\nof\nthe Conference, see Department of State Bulletin, April 29, 1945, p. 789.\n,646\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0708&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0708&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0708&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0708&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0708&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0708&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0708&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0707&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0709&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0707&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0709&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0708&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
