General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 485\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nsistence on action regarding the seating of the two Soviet Republics\nwould be sure to raise the Argentina question.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN said that he thought that the general tactics\nshould be that of attempting to delay action on the entire question,\nand to that end he thought the Delegation should give the Secretary\nfull authority to act when, as, and if necessary. He said that he\nthought that his original suggestion of having the Soviet Republics\nseated perhaps three weeks after the Conference was too much of a\nconcession.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY said that despite attempts to delay action, Mr.\nMolotov would insist that that question of the status of the two Soviet\nRepublics be settled before regard to the -issues which might be raised\non Argentina.\n  MfR. DUNN pointed out that it was almost impossible to organize\nthe Conference properly until the question of the two Soviet Republics'\nwas settled, since the Soviet Delegation was insisting that these two\nRepublics be given positions in the Conference organization. MR.\nPASVOLSEY suggested that it might be possible to set up an organiza-\ntion slate with two vacancies left for the Republics and to assure Mr.\nMolotov that representatives of the two Republics would be assigned\nto these positions whenever they were seated.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER said that the reason that Argentina was not\nbeing brought up at this point was that the American Republics did\nnot wish to disturb the possible success of the Conference, but that if\nthe Soviet Government insisted on pursuing its proposal for seating\nthe other two Republics, the American Republics would feel duty-\nbound to insist on the seating of Argentina.\n  THE SECRETARY suggested that the Delegation should take the week-\nend to consider the Argentina matter and to meet together early next\nweek to decide what course of action they should follow. As the Sec-\nretary left the meeting at the close of the Executive Session, MR.\nWARREN said that he wished to make clear that the support of the\nAriierican Republics for the admission of the two Soviet Republics as\ninitial members of the international organization was a gesture of sup-\nport for the late President Roosevelt; that they had not liked the pro-\nposal and that they had agreed to support it out of respect and honor\nto him.\nRSC Lot 60-D 224, Box 96: US Cr Min 22\nM1inutes of the Twenty-Second Meeting of the United States\n  Delegation, Held at San Francisco, Saturday, April 28, 194115,\n  9:30 a. m,.\n  [Here follows list of names of persons (42) present at meeting, and\nstatements by the delegates to the Advisers, announcement of sched-\n485\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
