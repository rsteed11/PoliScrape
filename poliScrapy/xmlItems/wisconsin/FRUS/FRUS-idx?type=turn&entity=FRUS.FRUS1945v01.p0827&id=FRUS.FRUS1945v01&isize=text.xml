Is there not equal\nreason to mention other organizations and if- so, why mention any\nof them?\n  MR. STINEBOWER supported the interpretation given by Dean Gil-\ndersleeve on the atmosphere of the afternoon meeting. He believed\nthat we would have to take a decisive stand to avoid an unfavorable\nvote. In answer to the Secretary's question, IVR. SANDIFER suggested\nthat the International Labor Organization differs from others that\nmight be included in the fact that, it has had a record of genuine\naccomplishment over a sufficiently long period of time to deserve rec-\nognition. He suggested that the proponents of the mention of the\norganization feel that its brilliant history should not only in this,\nfashion be recognized but that mention of the organization in the\nCharter would confirm its continuance as a successful body dealing\nwith important world labor problems and define the relations between\nthe world organization and itself.\n  MR. STASSEN pointed out that the real issue is the Trade Union\nproblem. The U.S.S.R. is clearly opposed to mention of the Inter-\nnational Labor Organization and insists that if that organization is;\nrecognized by the world Organization, the many millions of Russian\ntrade unionists would not have a voice in the Organization. It is a\nvery knotty problem. We gave in to England on the Act of Cha-\npultepec. They should give in to us on this issue.\n  THE SECRETARY, in polling the Committee, concluded that it was\nthe sense of the Committee to stand by the recommendation not to,\nmention the International Labor Organization in the Charter. MIR.\nKOTSCHNIG then read a rough draft of a report of the Subcommittee\nof Committee II/3.76 The draft had just been made a few minutes\nprior to this meeting and covered amendments to Chapter IX, Section\nA, paragraph 1. This draft was in response to efforts to spell out\nmore explicitly certain functions and obligations of the Economic\nand Social Council. There was strong vocal objection to the new\ndraft. MR. Duo Es opposed it on the ground that it would give the\nOrganization direct power to legislate on matters of domestic concern.\nSENATORS CONNALLY and VANDENBERG objected to the obligation to\npromote full employment. All agreed that the present wording\nwould make it possible for the Organization to encroach upon do-\nmestic matters and might, in fact, create a super state. SENATORS\nCONNALLY and VANDENBERG agreed that the Senate would be definitely\nopposed to the creation of such specific pledges and powers which in\ntheir fulfillment would require a heavy impingement upon the in-\nternal policies of member states.
