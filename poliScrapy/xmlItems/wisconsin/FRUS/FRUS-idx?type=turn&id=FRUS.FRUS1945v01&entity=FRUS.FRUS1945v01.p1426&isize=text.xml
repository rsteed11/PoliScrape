MR. PASVOLSKY pointed out that the docu-\nment under consideration was a treaty and hence involved certain\njuridical situations which had to be taken into account. MR. PASVOL-\nsKY outlined for the Delegation some of the history of the drafting\nof the Preamble. It had been sent to the Coordination Committee\nwith unusual directives, one of which was that the Coordination Com-\nmittee should consider the legal aspects of the phraseology. As a\nresult of this instruction, a joint committee had been set up with the\nJurists.32 This was the committee which Mr. Hackworth had been\ntalking about. The specific question at issue had been raised by the\nDutch, who had been contending that "Peoples" could not enter into\ncontracts. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM remarked that it had been his\nimpression that the peoples of the United Nations would enter into\nthe Charter through the agency of their respective governments. MR.\nPASVOLSKY observed, however, that even this was an impossible situa-\ntion for some governments. MR. HACKWORTH agreed with Mr. Pas-\nvolsky, and pointed out that in some countries the power of govern-\nment did not flow from the people, but came from above to the Crown.\nMR. NOTIER thought that the Delegation was confronted with a prac-\ntical situation. The practical problem was how it could be arranged\nthat the states represented at San Francisco could conceive the Orga-\nnization. Mr. Notter declared that personally, he was sympathetic\nwith those countries which were not ready to undergo an American\nRevolution. Even the words "The Peoples" represented a big con-\ncession for the Dutch. MR. NoTTER pointed out that much the same\nconstitutional situation applied to the United Kingdom as. applied to\nthe Netherlands. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM maintained that the people\nof the United States would be greatly disappointed if the word "We"\n-were not included in the Preamble. MR. PASVOLSKY observed that\nthis word would cause a much greater problem for some of the other\nDelegations than it would for the United States Delegation. He\npointed out that some Delegations would be repudiated by their gov-\nernments if they permitted the use of the words "We the Peoples".\nHe declared that the Preamble should be worded in such a way that\nit would be recognized that the governments concerned were becoming\nparties to the Charter as a result of an expression of determination\nby the peoples of their respective countries. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE\ndeclared that she recognized the fact that the Charter would not be\nan American instrument, but would be an International Charter.
