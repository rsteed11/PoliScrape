He thought there was very little\nreason for including one specific body at this point.\n  AM. EDEN said that he was inclined to agree that this was not the\nright place to refer to regional subcommittees of the Military Staff\n-Committee. He thought that this provision might be put in the re-\ngional section in Chapter VIII, Section- C, or in the paragraph on\nthe Military Staff Committee in Chapter VIII, Section B. He said\nthat he was willing to agree to the United States proposal to strike it\nout here provided that it should be considered in one of the other places\nthat he had mentioned.\n  MR. STEmTINIUS proposed that following Mr. Eden\'s suggestion this\nmatter be considered in connection with the provision concerning the\nMilitary Staff Committee in Chapter VIII, Section B.

EDEN said that his Delegation recognized the importance of\nnot cluttering up the Security Council with miscellaneous disputes,\nas had sometimes been the case with the League of Nations, but at\nthe same time it was their thought that if the countries parties to a\ndispute requested the Council to take it up, the facilities of the Council\nshould be available for this purpose.\n  The proposal was agreed to without discussion.\n                          CHAPTER VII\n  Paragraph 6.
