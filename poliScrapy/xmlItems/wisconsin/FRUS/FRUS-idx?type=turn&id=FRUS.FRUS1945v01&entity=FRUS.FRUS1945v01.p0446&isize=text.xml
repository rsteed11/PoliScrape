MOLOTOV said that in regard to Poland, his Government felt\nthat instead of friendly support in the matter of the establishment\nof a Polish Government friendly to the Soviet Union, obstacles had\nbeen continually put in its path by the U.S. and Great Britain. He\nsaid this had created quite a difference in atmosphere than that at the\nCrimean Conference. He said that now attempts were being made\nto speak to the Soviet Union in the language of a dictator; that the\nSoviet Union was in the first rank of the powers and would not be\npushed back into the second rank; that if the Soviet Union was\ntreated as a partner, it would react as a cooperative partner along the\nlines of the Crimea Conference but that if attempts were made using\nthe Polish situation as an excuse to dictate to the Soviet Union no\ngood would come out of it.\n  Tim SECRETARY said that there had been no change in our attitude\nsince the Crimea; that we maintained to carry out our agreements and\nthat all we asked was that the Polish leaders suggested by us be\naccepted for consultation.\n  MR. MoLoTov replied that Mr. Stettinius was aware of his position\nand that of his Government on this question. He concluded by saying\nthat if the Soviet Government was forced to accept anything but a\nfriendly government in Poland after all the Russian blood that had\nbeen shed for Polish liberation, any other solution would mean for\nthem that this blood had been shed in vain and they had lost the war.\nHe said that aggression had come to Russia through Poland twice\nin a generation and that they could not abandon the interest of their\nstate. He said that at the Crimean Conference the atmosphere had\nbeen satisfactory but since then they had noticed a definite change\nand that obstacles were being placed in the way of a formation of a\nPolish Government friendly to the Soviet Union.\n  THE SECRETARY denied that there had been any change in atmos-\nphere on the part of the United States.\n  It was agreed that at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning if Dr. Soong\nand Mr. Eden were agreeable there would be a meeting of the Foreign\nMinisters of the four powers to consider Conference arrangements\nand to begin the examination of amendments proposed by other coun-\ntries to the Dumbarton Oaks document, and that this meeting would\ntake place in Mr. Stettinius' office.87\n8 See minutes of meeting, April 25,11 a. m., p. 402.\n384\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
