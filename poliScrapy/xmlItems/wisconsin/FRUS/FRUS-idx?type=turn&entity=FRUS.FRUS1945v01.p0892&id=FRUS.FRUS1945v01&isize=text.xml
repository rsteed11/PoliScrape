General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 830\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nfavored a provision by which it would recommend the calling of a\nconference. As a working basis the following draft had been pre-\npared reading as follows:\n  "If circumstances of an international economic, social, cultural,\nhealth or other related character which, in the opinion of the Eco-\nnomic and Social Council, require a conference of all or any members\nof the Organization, the Economic and Social Council may recom-\nmend that such conference be called in accordance with the rules of\nprocedure determined by the General Assembly."\nMR. PASVOLSKY thought this was perfectly satisfactory and the mem-\nbers of the Delegation in general expressed approval of the draft as\nrevised.\n  MR. STINEBOWER explained that things had gone well in Committee\nII/3/a for the position taken by the United States, except that we\nhad been voted down on the proposal that "receive" should be substi-\ntuted for "obtain".\n    FULL EMPLOYMENT AS AN OBJECTIVE OF THE ORGANIZATION\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE pointed out that the question of the use of the\nterm "full employment" was still pending. THE, SECRETARY pointed\nout that a complete statement on the matter had appeared that morning\nin the papers and that he just could not see how the material could\nget out. He asked Mr. Stevenson if he could shed any light on the\nmatter. MiR. STEVENSON stated that, in so far as the interpretations in\nthe morning papers suggested that the use of the term "full employ-\nment" suggested that the world organization might interfere in inter-\nnal affairs, this had been obtained from conversations with our own\nrepresentatives. He said that nothing had been stated by his men\nconcerning procedural matters and he added that he had denied that\nthe United States was opposed to full employment.\n  DEAN GmrnaisLEEvE indicated that she wished the view of the Dele-\ngation on the strategy she should adopt in securing -reconsideration of\nthis question. She pointed out that she now planned to try to have\nthe first paragraph referred back to the subcommittee for revision on\nthe grounds (1) that a proposal for the addition of the word "educa-\ntional" had come up and that this matter should be given further\nconsideration, and (2) that, as worded, the matter of promotion of\nfull employment might be interpreted to mean interference in the\ndomestic affairs of states, so that the wording of this provision needs\nclarification.\n  THE SECRETARY expressed approval of this procedure. MR. STAs-\nSEN also indicated his agreement and the Delegation in general gave\ntheir consent.\n  THE SECRETARY asked what our actual position was on the use of\nthe words "full employment\'. MP..
