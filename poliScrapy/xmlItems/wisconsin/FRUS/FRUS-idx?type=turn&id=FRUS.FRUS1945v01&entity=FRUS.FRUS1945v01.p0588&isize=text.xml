General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 526\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\nthe same position as countries which were not present at Dumbarton\nOaks. The United States, he said, could not afford to just throw\nout the proposals or take them back. This Delegation, he urged,\nshould be sure of its proposals. Moreover, it should be borne in mind\nthat the United States will have to pay a price for any support given\nto its proposals.\n  MR. MAcLEISH called attention to the background of the situation.\nThe Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, he said, had been placed before the\npeople of the country. The precedent on which the government has\noperated with respect to these matters is complete frankness with the\npeople. It seemed to MP. MAcLEIsH to be helpful, rather than harm-\nful, to continue this policy. The American consultants, he added,\nwished to know if the United States Delegation is willing to take\none position or another....\n  MR. PASVOLSKY stated that none of the participants at Dumbarton\nOaks had announced their proposals at this time. He added that it\nhas been taken for granted by the other delegations that we would\nconsult first and then talk about the proposals publicly.\n  MR. BOWMAN urged that the Delegation should not run the risk of\nembarrassing its relations with other governments. These other gov-\nermnents, he said, should be consulted. There are, he added, two\nalternative procedures-the first would be mutual agreement among\nthe governments to release; the other would be to inform them that\nthe United States has decided to release its proposals.\n  Mi. PAsvoLsKY stated that there are several considerations to bear\nin mind: (1) No one is against telling the people of the country what\nthe Delegation is for. The only issue is that they be told at the right\ntime. The right time would be when the Delegation itself is ready\nto negotiate on them. (2) After Dumbarton Oaks the Government\nwent all out in its campaign to acquaint the people with the nature\nof these proposals. (3) The only important point at issue is that the\nUnited States cannot afford to put out several series of proposals.\nWhen the Delegation is agreed on the proposals then all the members\nshould do their "damndest" to get them adopted and to acquaint\nthe\npeople with them. (4) Before the end of the week all of the pro-\nposals must be in the hands of the International Secretariat, and that\nis the time to make them public. (5) Other governments still want\nto discuss points in the American proposals. They should be permit-\nted to do so before they are confronted with a fait accompli.\n-MR. PASVOLSKY commented that the United States will ask no one\'s\npermission to publish anything that it may wish to publish.
