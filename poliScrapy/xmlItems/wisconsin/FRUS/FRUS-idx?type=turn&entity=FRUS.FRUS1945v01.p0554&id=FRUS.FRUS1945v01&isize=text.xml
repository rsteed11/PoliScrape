General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 492\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked if under the Optional Clause a state\ncould agree to accept the jurisdiction of the Court, either generally\nor just with certain states. MR. JIACKWORTH replied that under the\nOptional Clause a state could go as far as it wished, i.e., it could\naccept the Court's jurisdiction for a limited period of time or for\ncertain types of cases, etc. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked if Russia\nwould object to that type of provision too. MR. HACKWORTH replied\nthat the United Kingdom and Russia were willing to accept the\nOptional Clause and, he supposed, the United States also. How-\never, he said, a large number of the small countries wanted the\ncompulsory jurisdiction provision. Therefore, he had suggested that\nthis article be put in alternative forms for the San Francisco\nConference.88\n  CONGRESSMAN EATON asked what argument these countries used in\ninsisting on compulsory jurisdiction. MR. HACKWORTH replied that\nthe little states seem to feel that it would be a great protection to\nthem if they could bring other countries, both large and small, into\nthe Court. CONGRESSMAN EATON remarked that he could see their\npoint.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG stated that he had the definite feeling that\nthis was one situation where we would have to depend upon evolution\nto reach the desired objective. He thought that a provision for\ncompulsory jurisdiction would be a red-danger signal in the Senate.\nHe recalled the Court fight in the Senate which he had gone through.\nHe felt, therefore, that the Optional Clause of the Statute must be\nretained for the purposes of the Senate. SENATOR CONNALLY agreed\nwith Senator Vandenberg. He felt that from the United States'\nstandpoint, the Optional Clause must be retained. He said if we\naccepted the compulsory jurisdiction provision, we would not know\nwhat suits would be brought against us by other countries, both in\nthis hemisphere and elsewhere. He thought, therefore, that the\noptional jurisdiction provision should be retained. He noted that\nunless nations were willing to submit a dispute to the Court on an\noptional basis, the case would probably have to go to the Security\nCouncil in any event.\n  MR. DuLLEs observed that everybody would like to have the compul-\nsory jurisdiction clause, but that we would have to move toward it\nthrough the process of evolution. He thought that the United States'\nacceptance of the Court Statute with the Optional Clause would be\nas great a step at present as would be practical.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN thought that this country had moved a long\nway from the old debates in the Senate on the world court.
