He also noted that the other commentaries sup-\nported the view that the number of members of each country in the\nAssembly not be limited.\n  DR. PASVOLSKY stated that various criticisms had been voiced regard-\ning the limited powers of the Assembly. He explained that in all\nthe discussions he had tried to make clear the point that in building\nthe organization, an attempt had been made to plan it (for effectiveness\nof Faction) oin the-principletthat the functiowss of the organization Would\nnot be assigned to two bodies at the same time, but that each would\nhave its own responsibilities. He stated that the word "primary"\nin connection with the Security Council meant that there would be\nsome functions relating to the maintenance of peace and security which\nwould rest with the General Assembly, and that therefore there had\nbeen included the sentence reading . . . "Any question relating to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security . . . and to make\nrecommendations with regard to any such principles or questions."\nHe said the Assembly was completely free to deal in its discussions\nwith any question arising in the field of international peace and secu-\nrity and could take up on its own initiative and make any recomrnenda-\ntions it wished to on questions referred to it by the Security Council;\nthat the Security Council also had the right to bring before the As-\nsembly questions with which it was concerned and to make recom-\nmendations; that there were however two limitations: (1) responsi-\nbility was divided according to the body competent to take action-\ni.e. in a case where the Council was dealing -with a matter serious\nenough for the Council to be concerned with it, then the Assembly\nshould make it possible for the Council to carry out its heavy responsi-\nbility; (2) in the light of past experience it seemed very necessary\nto establish a system for the maintenance of peace and security which\nwould place primary responsibility for action in a body at all times\nprepared to carry out this responsibility and one, as the Security\nCouncil was designed to be, which would remain in continuous session\nand not meet only periodically as would the Assembly. He then\nsaid that it was obvious that peace and security would be maintained\nonly if the\' nations \'of the world should develop; among themselves\nrelations requiring a minimum of adjustments that most of them\nmust be willing to behave-with only a few law-breakers, - He pointed\nout that obviously if most countries were not willing to support the\nprinciples of the world organization it would be a complete failure;\nthat in this respect the problems of international relations would con-\nstitute is very important\' functioli of the Assembly and that if the\' As-\nsembly failed to meet them, the Security Council would be powerless\n32\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
