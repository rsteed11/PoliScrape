He remarked that it would undoubtedly cause difficulties\nif the principle of rotating chairmanship should be adopted; con-\nfusion might arise when one chairman succeeded another. He re-\nmarked that this entire question had been reviewed in detail by both\nPresident Roosevelt and President Truman, and that they both agreed\nthat it was desirable to have one presiding officer who would have\nfull authority.\n  MR. MOLOTOV stated that he had explained the position of the Soviet\nGovernment.\n  MR. EDEN remarked that it was really a matter of procedure and\na question of efficiency. He reminded Mr. Molotov that at the Moscow\nConference, which had been a very great success, Mr. Molotov as\nhost had been elected chairman of the Conference,76 and therefore he\nfelt that the same principle should apply in this case and that the\nForeign Minister of the country in which the Conference was held\nshould be elected chairman.\n  MR. MOLwTOV replied that at the Moscow Conference he had sug-\ngested that there be three chairmen, and although this proposal had\nnot been accepted he felt that in order to preserve the question of\nequality four chairmen should be elected to preside over the San\nFrancisco Conference.\n  DR. SOONG stated that he believed it was a question of efficiency\nand for this reason he felt that one chairman should be elected. He\nadded that as regards the question of equality anyone may be elected\nchairman, but he felt that whoever is elected should remain chairman\nthroughout the entire Conference.\n  Mm. STEawNIus stated that Mr. Hiss had studied this question care-\nfully and perhaps he could clarify certain points regarding this\nmatter.\n  MR. Hiss replied that there was little he could add to what had\nalready been stated but that he could review what Mr. Gromyko and\nthe others had said in regard to this, when it was discussed a short\ntime ago.\n  MR. MOLOTOV stated that he was familiar with these discussions.\n  MR. SaMNrwius asked whether it was believed advisable to throw\nthis question into the whole Conference.\n  MR. MOLOTOV asked why it should not be decided by the Conference\nas a whole.\n  ME. STErTINwUs replied that he had no objection to this but it would\n  76  summary of the proceedings of the first session of the Moscow.
