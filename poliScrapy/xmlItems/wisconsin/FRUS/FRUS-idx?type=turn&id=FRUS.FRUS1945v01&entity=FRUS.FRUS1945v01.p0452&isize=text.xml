We also recognize that they wish to have as\nmuch domination over Eastern Europe as possible, and that as the\nRed Army has advanced, governments in Eastern Europe have tended\nto come under the domination of the army. While we cannot go to\nwar with Russia, we must do everything we can to maintain our posi-\ntion as strongly as possible in Eastern Europe. Russia is building a\ntier of friendly states there and our task is to make it difficult for her\nto do so, since to build one tier of states implies the possibility of\nfurther tiers, layer on layer. Our whole position, Ambassador Harri-\nman said, the one advantage we had, was to stand firm on our position\nin Eastern Europe. He added that he felt just as warmly on this\nquestion as Senator Vandenberg, and that he recommended that we\nbe as firm with the Russians as possible.\n  Ambassador Harriman pointed out that the Polish question was the\nmajor question, and that we should not confuse it with the admission\nof the two Soviet republics to the Conference or to membership in the\nOrganization. Ambassador Harriman indicated that the basic issue\nat Yalta had been the voting procedure on the Security Council, on\nwhich the Administration had taken a strong position and on which\nthere had been no weakening. When the President had put this posi-\ntion up to Stalin, Stalin had agreed to accept it for the admission of\nthe two Russian republics.99 He thought the special interest of Stalin\nin the two Russian republics reflected a problem of Communist con-\ntrol in the Ukraine and in the White Russian Republic.\n  Senator Connally asked whether Ambassador Harriman meant that\nthe Russian proposal stemmed from a situation of domestic politics.\nAmbassador Harriman replied in the affirmative. He thought that\nStalin was attempting to achieve a favorable public opinion in the\ntwo republics. He pointed out that we must face the fact that the\nforeign policies of the two republics would be dictated by the Kremlin,\nand that those republics were not autonomous. He noted that Stalin\nplaced; a great deal of emphasis upon the international recognition of\nthese two republics, and that the question of their votes in the assembly\nwas only a secondary one. Mr. Bowman questioned whether, on\nachieving two extra seats in the Assembly, it was likely that the Soviet\nGovernment would press for additional seats for other constituent\nrepublics. Ambassador Harriman replied that there was no doubt\nabout this, and that that was the reason why the President had tied\nthe matter of admitting the two republics to the particular circum-\nstances of the war, in which they had suffered so heavily. It was\nclear, he said, that further demands would be made by the Soviet\nGovernment. Mr. Stassen asked whether the President agreed to the\nSoviet proposals because of the Polish quid pro quo.
