Hesaid that the President had approved it,\nand he intended to release it to the press immediately. All the Latin\nAmericans had accepted by this time. MR. PASVOLSKY asked who\nhad the master copy. MR. DUNN said he had it, but that the Secretary\n-would keep it in his hands. THE SECRETARY said he thought all were\nsatisfied; the British, Chinese, French and Latin Americans. The\nU.S.S.R., had had no instructions.\n  The meeting was adjourned until the following morning at 9 o\'clock.\n500.CC/5-1545\n   Memorandunm of Conversation, by the Acting Secretary of State\n                                     [WASHINGTON,] May 5, 15945.\n  The Swiss Minister 42 called on me this afternoon at his request.\n  In connection with the San Francisco Conference, the Minister\nwondered what the position of Switzerland would be in relation to\nthe eventual world organization. I said it was hoped that all "peace-\nloving countries" would eventually become members of the organiza,-\ntion and I supposed that of course Switzerland would be one of the\nfirst to be invited to\' join. The Minister said that this would be\ndifficult in view of the fact that Switzerland\'s neutrality is provided\nfor by law and that in the case of Swiss membership in the League\nof Nations Switzerland had insisted upon a special clause providing\nthat, in view of her neutrality, Switzerland would not be called upon\nto participate in sanctions against any country. He thought it would\nbe impossible for Switzerland to become a member of the proposed\nworld organization, in which Switzerland might be called upon to\nparticipate in the use of force against another country, which would\nviolate her neutrality, and that if she were to join a special exception\nwould probably have to be made in her case. He thought that Soviet\nRussia, which does not like Switzerland, might refuse to permit such\nan exception. I said that I could not answer this question in advance\nof the setting up of the world organization.\n                                                 JOSEPH C.
