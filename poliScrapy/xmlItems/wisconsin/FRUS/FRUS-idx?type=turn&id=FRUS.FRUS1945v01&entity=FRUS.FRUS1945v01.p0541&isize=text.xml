General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 479\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG suggested that it might be given to the\nPreamble Committee to handle.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY remarked that he would be in a much better\nposition with respect to the proposals of the other governments if\nwe had a short draft of our own.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY suggested that it would be better if we would take\na look at the preambles of the other delegations and then suggest\none of our own, but if we should introduce a preamble proposal of\nour own first, the other groups would try to tack things on to it.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY repeated that any proposal on the preamble\nthat we might advance should be short and business-like.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY suggested that the matter might be left to Com-\nmittee I/i to propose a preamble after that Committee had examined\nthe suggestions of the other delegations.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG inquired whether there were any other sug-\ngestions and in the absence of any stated that it was agreed that the\nprocedure outlined by Mr. Pasvolsky would be followed. He then\ncalled attention to the subject of withdrawal.\n     REGISTRATION OF TREATIES AND REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\n  SENATOR CONNALLY stated that there should be a provision some-\nwhere in the. Charter requiring imembers making treaties of alliance\nto register them.\n. MR. PAsVOLSKY pointed out that there was tnot only the question\nof registration of treaties but also inconsistent obligations, and M-.\nDuuLEs inquired whether the recent Russian-Polish treaty 73 involved\nan inconsistent obligation.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY commented that this raises a very difficult problem.\nIt is not a matter of a proposal. The Franco-Russian treaty,74 for\nexample, raises certain special questions, for this was directed solely\nagainst Germany. The British, he said, had already raised -the ques-\ntion as to what position we would take on this matter. If the\nFrench advance a claim, he said, we would probably have to allow\nthat claim, but only with the very clear understanding that if the\nOrganization takes over the functions of the victor nations with\nregard to the control of Germany and Japan, then the Franco-\nRussian treaty would become inconsistent with the provisions of the\nCharter,\n  MR. DuMTLEs remarked that there should be more liberality with\nrespect to regional rather than bilateral arrangements.\nF3For agreement regarding friendship, mutual assistance, and postwar co-\noperation, between the Soviet Union and the Polish Republic (National Council\nof the Homeland), signed at Moscow on April 21, 1945, see Department of State,\nDocuments and State Papers, vol. i, No. 4 (July 1948), p. 231.\n74 For treaty of alliance and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union\nand\nthe Provisional Government of the French Republic, signed at Moscow, December\n10, 1944, see ibid., p. 230.\n479\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
