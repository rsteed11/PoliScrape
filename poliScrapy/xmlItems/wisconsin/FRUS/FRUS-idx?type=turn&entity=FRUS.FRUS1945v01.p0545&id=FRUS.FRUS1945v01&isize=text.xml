General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 483\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nproposal in a short statement and that it had been voted unanimously\nby the Steering Committee. THE SECRETARY said that Mr. Molotov\nthen raised the question of seating representatives of these two Re-\npublics at this Conference. In this connection, he said that the Brit-\nish Dominions were not at all helpful in the debate and it was with\nsome difficulty that the matter had been referred to the Executive\nCommittee for action at that Committee\'s next meeting. He said\nthat Mr. Molotov had tried unsuccessfully to have a report on this\nmatter made available in twenty-four hours.\n  8. THE SECRETARY reported the next major item taken up by the\nSteering Committee concerned the question of inviting Poland to the\nConference. He said that such a proposal was made by Mr. Masaryk\nof Czechoslovakia.78 The Secretary had formally replied that such\na proposal could not be accepted in view of the Crimea agreement.\nMr. Eden then endorsed the United States position in this matter.\nOther countries objected to introducing such a matter into this Con-\nference, and a motion by Foreign Minister Spaak (Belgium) on this\nquestion was adopted unanimously. The sense of Spaak\'s motion was\nthat the question of Poland did not belong before this Conference but\ninstead was a matter for the three major powers concerned to settle\namong themselves.\n        CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PRESDENT AND MR. HuLL\n  Following this long report of the activities in the Steering Commit-\ntee during the day, THE SECRETARY also said that there were two other\nmatters which he wished to report to the Delegation:\n  1. He said that he had reported on the happenings of the day by\ntelephone to the President, who was both delighted and pleased; and\nthat the President now felt that the Conference was off to a good\nstart. THE SECRETARY said that he advised the President that there\nwas another big hurdle looming, and this involved the seating of the\ntwo Soviet Republics at the Conference, as well as the question of\nArgentina. He said that the; President told him that if the seating\nof these two Republics and Argentina did not involve the signing of\nthe United Nations Declaration, he would give the United States Dele-\ngation full power and responsibility to deal with this question as best\nthey could when it arose.79\n78For summary discussion regarding admission of Poland, following statement\nby Jan Masaryk, chairman of Czechoslovak delegation, see doc. 30, DC/5(1),\nApril 27, UNCIO Documents, vol. 5, p. 93.\n71 In his message to President Truman reporting on developments at the Con-\nference on April 27th (telegram 3, April 28), Mr. Stettinius stated: "At\nmy\npress conference this afternoon I released the President\'s letter to me directing\nme, pursuant to the commitment assumed by President Roosevelt at Yalta, to\nsupport the Soviet request for initial membership for the Ukrainian and White\nRussian Republics."
