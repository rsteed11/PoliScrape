I should not however propose to mention this in, any reply\nto M. Molotov.\n5OO.CC/3-2245\nMemorandum by the Acting Secretary of State to President Roosevelt\n                                     WASHINGTON, March 22, 1945.\n  I talked to Ed Stettinius this morning over the telephone,95 and\nhe spoke of a matter which I think should be brought to your atten-\ntion. It refers to the question of the two Soviet Republics being\nproposed for admission to initial membership in the International\nOrganization with our support in accordance with the discussions at\nYalta. It appears that this matter is known to quite a number of\npeople, including some of the Press, and we know ourselves that the\nBritish and the Canadians here know of it and have no doubt spoken\nof it to their friends. In these circumstances it would seem highly\nadvisable that you call together the American delegates to the Con-\nference before you leave town,96 tell them the facts of the situation,\nand ask their advice as to how this matter should be dealt with. It\nwould seem possible to tell the delegates that in order to accomplish\nother things of very great importance there seemed to be no reason\nwhy this minor request should not have been agreed to, and the dele-\ngates might also be informed that you are in possession of letters\nfrom both Marshal Stalin and Prime- Minister Churchill I that, if\n(so desired, the United States might also avail itself of an opportunity\nto arrange for additional representation by its outlying territories.98\n  It would seem advisable to inform the delegates because, if by any\nchance the story should break publicly, it might cause considerable\nembarrassment to the Government, and there is no telling of the effect\nit might have on some of the delegates, particularly if they had not\nbeen informed beforehand.\n   The Secretary was at his farm, "The Horseshoe".\n   "President Roosevelt was to go to Warm Springs, Georgia.\n   F For letters of February 11 from Prime Minister Churchill and Marshal\nStalin\nto President Roosevelt, see Conferences at Matta and Yalta, pp. 967-96$.\n  "For President Roosevelt\'s off-the-record account of how "this\nplea for votes\nwas done" at Yalta, see memorandum on his press conference April 5,\np. 196.\nSee also Robert E.
