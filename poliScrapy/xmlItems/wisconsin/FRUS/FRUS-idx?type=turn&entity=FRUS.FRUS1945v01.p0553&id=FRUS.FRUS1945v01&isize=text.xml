General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 491\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\ninform the United States Delegation at the earliest moment as to the\nmembership of this committee.\n  MR. DuLL s observed that it would be desirable to decentralize this\nwork. He noted that on this trusteeship question, the Delegation had\nconsidered primarily the military aspects, but that other countries\nwould raise many other considerations, such as the Dutch East Indies,\netc. He thought, therefore, that Commander Stassen would need\nadvisers other than the Army and Navy people. CONGRESSMAN\nBLOOM thought that with all due respect to Commander Stassen there\nshould be some one representative from Congress dealing with this\nsubject.\n  SENATOR CONNA.LLY noted that the Army and Navy- advisers took\nthe position that strategic bases would be under the Security (Council,\nand that other areas would be under the Assembly. He noted that\nSenator Vandenberg was associated with both Commission II and,\nCommission III and therefore Senator Vandenberg should handle,\nthis matter with Commander Stassen. COMMANDER STASSEN observed\nthat this present consultation was merely to present the U.nited States\nDelegation document regarding trusteeship to the other four govern-\nments, and to explain to them informally what the United States Dele-\ngation intends. This was just a preliminary consultation and before\nanything would be decided, the full Delegation would be informed.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE: COMPULSORY JURISDICTION\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked Mr. Hackworth to present a report to,\nthe Delegation on the work of the Committee of Jurists in Washing-\nton.86 Since Senator Connally and Senator Vandenberg had to leave\nin a few minutes, Mr. -ackworth was asked to take up the subject of\ncompulsory jurisdiction first.\n  MR. HACKWORTI stated that in the Committee of Jurists there had\nbeen a considerable demand to write compulsory jurisdiction into the\nStatute of the International Court, particularly on the part of the\nsmall powers and also on the part of such countries as China and\nBrazil. On the other hand, he reported that the USSR, the United\nKingdom, Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Norway, Haiti, and France were\nopposed to compulsory jurisdiction and supported the Optional Clause\nof the present Statute, which also appears in the United States draft.87\nThese countries stated that they would not be parties to the Statute\nif it contained a provision for compulsory jurisdiction. MR. HACK-\nWORTH stated that this situation presented a real problem.\n86 See memorandum on this subject by the Secretary of State to President\nTru-\nman, April 23, p. 362; for documents on the meeting of the Uhnited Nations\nCom-\nmittee of Jurists, April 9-28,1945, see UNCIO Documents, vol. 14.\n87 For text of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Juntice\nwith\nrevisions proposed by the United States, see Jurist 5, G/5, April 9, ibid.,\np. 323;\nfor article 36 (compulsory jurisdiction), see ibid., p. 338.\n491\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0553&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0553&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0553&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0553&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0553&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0553&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0553&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0552&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0554&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0552&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0554&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0553&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
