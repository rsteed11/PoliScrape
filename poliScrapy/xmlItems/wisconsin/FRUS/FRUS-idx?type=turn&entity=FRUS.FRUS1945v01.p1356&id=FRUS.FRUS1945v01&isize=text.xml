General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1294\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nDunn had seemed to approve of this suggestion. He had suggested\nas an appropriate wording "or if an amendment duly accepted by the\nnecessary majority in the Assembly fails of ratification necessary to\nbring it into effect."\n  MR. ARMSTRONG declared that the smaller powers appeared to be\nworried about China, which might break up into a group of small\nsegments controlled by war lords or might fall completely under\nSoviet domination. Mr. Evatt had told Mr. Armstrong in the tele-\nphone conversation that morning that he had received instructions\nfrom his own government to stand for a revisionary convention which\nwould be free of any restraining veto power whatsoever. However,\nMr. Evatt had indicated that it would not be necessary to hold such\na convention within five years and had indicated that ten years would\nbe soon enough.\n  MR.

Commander Stassen pointed out that,\nas a result of the failure of the major powers to reach agreement, the\nUnited States now had freedom of action, and he thought that it was\nessential that he be granted license to work out an appropriate solu-\ntion. Commander Stassen declared that it might even be necessary\nto adapt Senator Rolin\'s draft statement to be included in the report\nof Commission I.
