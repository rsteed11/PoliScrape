General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 353\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n  He they stated that he had instructions from his Government to\nltak~ ip three items:\n  1. That it was impossible for his Government to agree on the names\n-of Commissions and Committees at the San Francisco Conference\nas proposed by our Government because of the failure to reach agree-\nment oniih6e Chairmanship of these Committees and Commissions and\nagreement on the matter of the participation of Ukraine and Byelo-\nrussia (White Russia).\n  2. That originally it had been proposed by the United States Gov-\nernment that no observers be admitted at the San Francisco Con-\nference who were not members of the United Nations; that this de-\ncision, his Government feels, covers -the question of the nationality\nof representation from the other international organizations who have\nin their groups members who are not citizens of the United Nations\nattending the Conference. He mentioned in particular Mr. Lester,\nan Irishman of Aragon, who was on the United Nations list.\n  3. The Ambassador stated that it was the desire of his Government\nthat this Government and the other sponsors agree that no pro"osals\n;be accepted by any individuals; that only proposals for amendent\n\'to the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals be accepted from individual mem-\n\'bers of the Delegation. To clarify the matter, I said you mean that\nif Mexico has an amendment to offer, they are to offer it through their\nDelegation and you think it not proper to hear from a member of\nthe      a ion as you might not be sure that he was speaking for\nthe Delegation. He said tat covered -it precisely. I said the United\nStates was in full agreement with that position.\n  I asked the Ambassador when he expects Mr. Molotov to arrive.\nHe stated he knew less than I did and he would appreciate being kept\ninformed. I said that we would keep him informed and that Mr.\nThompson would undertake the responsibility of advising the Em-\nbassy in \'advance of the arrival time and place of arrival in order\nthat the Ambassador and members of the staff who might wish to do\nso might meet Mr. Molotov.\n.500.CC/4-1945\n  Memorandum by the Secretary of State to President Truman\n                                   [WASHINGTON,) April 19, 1945.\nSubject: Charter for the International Organization.\n  The American Delegation to the United Nations Conference on\nInternational Organization is unanimously agreed that we should\npropose a few alterations in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals during\nthe San Francisco Conference.60 We will reserve our final positions\n  6&#176;The proposed amendments outlined In this memorandum were based on\na\npaper entitled "Tentative U.S. Revisions of the Proposals", which\nhad been dis-\ncussed by the delegation paragraph by paragraph, and on the resultant memo-\nrandum, "Substantive Decisions on the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals Reached\non\nApril 18 by the American Delegation [On basis of draft, April 16, 1945 (yellow\npaper)]", neither printed (U.S. Doe.
