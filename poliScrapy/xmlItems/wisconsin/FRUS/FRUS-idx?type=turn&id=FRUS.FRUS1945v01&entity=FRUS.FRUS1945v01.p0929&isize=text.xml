General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 867\n\n\nUNTITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nserved notice that the French were reserving their position on this\nquestion. MR. DUNN expressed the opinion that if it proved to be\nnecessary to change "consent" to "request" we should\ndo so because\nthe only change would be in the psychological approach. This word-\ning would be important, he said, to any French Government. SENATOR\nCONNALLY pointed out that the change in wording would merely\nchange the initiative. MR. ARMSTRONG thought, however, this new\nwording would preclude the Assembly from discussing matters per-\ntaining to enforcement, but MR. PASVOLSKY was of the opinion that\nthe new wording would affect only the taking of the final decision.\nMR. DUNN reiterated that this was an important point politically to\nthe French Delegation. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked whether he\nwas right in his impression that "consent" and "request"\nwere prac-\ntically the same and both SENATOR CONNALLY and MR. DUNN agreed\nthat was correct. SENATOR VANDENBERG then added that in the final\nanalysis the signatory power would have the final word under either\nphraseology. MR. DUNN said that he would oppose making a big\nchange in this paragraph, but was in favor of the substitution of\n"consent" for "request".\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked what was the opinion of the Delegation\non giving Mr. Pasvolsky authority, if necessary, to support the change\nunder discussion. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE voted in favor of this proce-\ndure with misgivings. SENATOR VANDENBERG and REPRESENTATIVE\nEATON likewise voted affirmatively. COMMANDER STASSEN dissented\nemphatically and declared that this change could be made only with\nthe approval of President Truman. It was closely tied in, he de-\nclared, with the entire question of freedom of action.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked whether it was true that France had not\nparticipated in the discussion of this question and COMMANDER STASSEN\ndeclared that separate consultations had been held with them. Mr.\nMolotov, he declared, had refused to agree to the wording until he\nhad a chance to discuss the solution with the French representatives.85\nCONGRESSMAN BLOOM suggested that we defer the question and see if\nMr. Pasvolsky could not do better. If necessary, he said, he would\ngo along with the change against his better judgment.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY then requested authorization to inform the Commit-\ntee that the United States did not consent to the change and supported\nreferring the matter to the Chairman of the Delegations of the Five\nPowers. The Committee agreed to this although SENATOR VANDEN-\nBERG declared that he did not like the decision. REPRESENTATIVE\nEATON concurred in SENATOR VANDENBERG\'S sentiments. The latter\nwanted to know- why a major issue should be made of this question\nand declared that it was too deep for him. France, he said, had a\n85 See minutes of the first Pive-Power informal consultative meeting, May\n7,\n3 p. m., p. 628.\n867\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0929&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0929&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0929&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0929&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0929&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0929&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0929&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0928&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0930&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0928&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0930&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0929&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
