General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 687\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n  COMMANDER STASSEN requested permission of the Delegation to\npresent the Working Paper draft to Committee II/4 as the basic\nworking paper for its deliberations at its 11: 30 meeting on Monday\nmorning, provided the Soviet Union and the British accept it in its\npresent form.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN inquired whether he would have permission of\nthe Delegation to move this draft as a working paper on Monday in\nCommittee II/4 if the Army and Navy approve it.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG inquired whether there were any objections\nand in the absence of any the request of Commander Stassen was ap-\nproved. SENATOR VANDENBERG asked Commander Stassen if he\nwould like to comment on the position taken by Senator Byrd with\nrespect to the American right of possession in the Pacific.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN stated that the United States has the right of\npossession. This right of possession, he emphasized, can be kept if the\ncountry has national backbone and if satisfactory trusteeship arrange-\nments for these territories cannot be negotiated.\n              ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COOPERATION\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE stated that she would like to seek some advice.\nShe stated that she would be pushed into a corner if the Committees\nare going on. She would have need for guidance, although she realized\nthat all of the members of the Delegation were now tired after a long\nmeeting.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG inquired whether the Delegation would do\nanything about this now. He stated that it was only ll: 50 and\nsuggested that Dean Gildersleeve might be given an hour at this\ntime.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE stated that if this were to be done she would\nlike to have Mr. Stinebower come into the meeting. A group of the\nAmerican advisers and technical experts on this subject of economic\nand social cooperation had held a number of meetings, she said. They\nhad gone over the amendments which had been submitted to the Com-\nmittee, and especially the Canadian redraft. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE\nstated that she would like to get guidance on some of these points.\n  With respect to putting in "educational" as well as "cultural",\nDEAN GILDERSLEEVE stated that she had taken the line that "educa-\ntional" should be kept out, since this would make trouble in Congress.\nShe expressed the view that "cultural" covers "educational",\nbut if\nother countries insist on the inclusion of "educational", DEAN\nGILDER-\nSLEEVE inquired whether she should vote against it.\n  With respect to Chapter IX, paragraph 1, she said, a number of\nnations, and especially Haiti, desired to have "educational" inserted.\n78 Do. 310, 11/4/11, May 15, UNCIO Documents, vol. 10, p. 439.\n687\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
