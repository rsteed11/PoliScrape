MR. BLOOM remarked that the Aus-\ntralian proposal is impossible and after MR.

COMMANDER STASSEN\nthought that the whole story should be given on a background basis\nbut SENATOR VANDENBERG thought it should come from him and\nshould not be detailed. SENATOR CONNALLY said that in his opinion\nthe less that was said now the better and asked what really could\nbe given out at the present time. To this THE SECRETARY replied\nthat the press contend that they can obtain all the background infor-\nmation they want from the British, but none from us, and added that\nthat is not a desirable situation. SENATOR VANDENBERG said that he\nthought that as soon as we know that we are in the clear-that is\nthat the Latin Americans are reasonably satisfied-we should give\nout the text. It was agreed not to make any statement until after\nthe forthcoming discussion with the Latin American representatives.\n  NiW ZEALAND AND CANADIAN AMENDMENTS IN COMMiTTrE III/3\n  SENATOR CONNALLY brought up the New Zealand proposal in Com-\nmittee III/3 regarding the role of the Assembly in enforcement\naction.97 He- said that he and Commander Stassen were opposed to\nthis amendment and had assumed that this was the Delegation\'s\nview. THE SECRETARY said that it was.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY then mentioned the Canadian amendment98\nto allow states not members of the Security Council to sit as voting\nmembers when the use of their forces is under consideration. He said\n  "The Mexican amendment proposed that the Secretary General be elected\nupon nomination by a simple majority of the members of the Security Council;\nthe Australian amendment proposed that he be elected by the Assembly subject\nto confirmation by a majority of any seven members of the Security Council\nand\na majority of ten members of the Economic and Social Council (Doc. 294, I1/1/10,\nMay 14, UNCIO Documents, vol. 8, p. 323).\n  9 The New Zealand delegate submitted a motion at the fourth meeting of\nCom-\nmittee III/3 on May 10 "that this Committee express its approval of\nthe plan\nthat in all matters of the application of sanctions, military or economic,\nthe\nSecurity Council associate with itself the General Assembly" (Doc. 231,\nIII/3/9.\nMay 11, ibid., vol. 12, p. 295).\n  98Ibid., p. 297.\n     723-681 -67  49\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
