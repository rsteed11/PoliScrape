At the outset hLe denounced the British proposal that the\nUnited States should occupy southern Germany and France or have\nany responsibility for Italy and the Balkans. The burden of recoii-\nstruction, of those areas is "not our natural task at a distance of\n3500\nmiles or more." The President defined the principal object of the\nUnited States as "not to take part in internal problems in southern\nEurope but . . . rather to take part in eliminating Germany as a\npossible and even probable cause of a third world war." This we could\nbest do from the northwest. British objections to American occupa-\ntion of this area were dismissed by the President. \'Cross-over" of\nmilitary forces is entirely feasible, the British desire to control naval\nbases on the Baltic is a question of lonlg-range security, not of first\noccupation, and there will be, thought the President, ample time to\nwork that out. "Americans by that time will be only too glad to retire\nall their military forces from Europe." Supply and shipping problems\nfor our war with Japan will provide enough problems at a distance\nof 3500 sea-miles without our becoming involved in land transport\nto the center of the continent of Europe. The President nailed down\ntightly his arguments in conclusion, "If anything further is needed\nto\njustify this agreement [disagreement] with the British line of demar-\ncation, I can only add that political considerations in the United States\nmake my decision conclusive.\'9t t\n  This statement of American policy was sent to Ambassador Winant\non February 25 [26] together with a copy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\nproposals which had been submitted to the British Chiefs at Cairo\nin December.1t Ambassador Winant replied, in response to these in-\nstructions, that he was unable to present the Chiefs of Staff proposals\nto the European Advisory Commission. It was now out-dated by late\ndevelopments. The area boundaries defined by the United States would\ncut the Soviet area into half of that already agreed upon by the Brit-\nish and the Soviets. Such a counter-claim without adequate reasons\nto substantiate it, and these had not been furnished, would only jeop-\nardize relations with the Soviet Union. Furthermore the Ambassador\nfelt that the Joint Chiefs\' proposals were faulty in that the zone lines\ndid not follow German administrative boundaries. Mr. Winant there-\nfore asked for a restatement of the American position which he could\npresent to the Commission and he recommended that we accept the\noccupation boundaries as agreed upon by the British and the Soviets\nwithholding, of course, approval of the allocation of southern Ger-\nmany to the United States.&#223;&#223;\n  ttMemorandum from the President for the Acting Secretary of State, 21 Feb.\nruary 1944.
