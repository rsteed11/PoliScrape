General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 536\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\nresult of this discussion, they wanted to propose the elimination of\ncertain amendments in the American list. (Document A)\n  Chapter I, Purposes.-The first suggestion was that the proposed\nrevision of Chapter I, paragraph 1 (adding after "peaceful means"\nthe clause "and in accordance with the principles of justice and\nequity") should be altered to read "with due regard to the principles\nof justice and international law".\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said that he was willing to accept the Chinese\nversion 63 on this point. He thought it would produce the same atmos-\nphere and it would achieve the purpose of including international law.\nThe Delegation agreed to the change proposed by Mr. Pasvolsky.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY proposed that the suggested amendment of para-\ngraph 2 (to include the phrase "to foster the development of inter-\nnational law") should be dropped since it did not add anything to\nthe document. A reference to international law would be in para-\ngraph 1 of this Chapter and in paragraph 6, Section B, Chapter V\nof the General Assembly. SENATOR CONNALLY asked if the Delegates\nagreed to this change and they gave their assent.\n  Mi. PASVOLSKY asked the Delegates if the word "cultural" could\nbe added after the word "social" in paragraph 3. The Delegates\nagreed to this change and no change was made in the revision already\nproposed for that paragraph (to add after "problems" the clause\n"and\nto promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms").\n  Chapter II, Principles.-MR. PASVOLSKY suggested retaining the\nproposed amendment to paragraph 1 (substituting "its members" for\n"peace loving states"). The Delegates agreed.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY suggested that the proposed amendments to para-\ngraphs 5 and 6 and the unnumbered paragraph should be dropped.\nThat meant going back to the original language of the Dumbarton\nOaks document. However, some textual changes might be made in\nthe course of drafting. MR. DuINN said that the dropping of these\namendments was recommended by himself, Mr. Dulles, Mr. Pasvolsky,\nMr. Bowman and Mr. Armstrong who had met together in the course\nof the afternoon. SENATOR VANDENBERG asked what would happen\nto the proposed insertion in paragraph 5 of the phrase "in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Charter in any action taken by it under the\nprovisions of the Charter." MR. DULLES said that this had been\nmerely a drafting change in the first place and as it was stated now\nit made the phrase "any action" much too broad. He thought that\nthe result that the American Delegates wanted to achieve could be\nbrought about in the drafting process.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG commented that what Mr. Pasvolsky sug-\ngested was really postponing this particular problem. MR. HACK-\nWORTH said that this was a matter of shifting emphasis.
