General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 308\n\n\n308           FOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\nTreaty of 1919.99 It was agreed that this was a separate subject but\nSENATOR VANDENBERG considered it utterly fundamental.\n                  MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT\n  As the meeting was apparently drawing to a close, SENATOR CON-\n-XALLY statedAthat President Truman would receive the Delegation at\n9: 00 a. m. on W6dnesday.1e\n             CHAPTER VIII, SECTION A, PARAGRAPH 7 2i\n  At AIR.; PASVOLSKY\'S suggestion the meeting then passed to a re-\nconsideration of Chapter VIII, Section A, paragraph 7, concerning\n"situations or disputes arising out of matters which by international\nlaw are solely within the domestic jurisdiction of the state concerned."\nMR. PASVOLSKY said it was a question of whether (1) the paragraph\nshould limit the effects of the section to paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5,\nor from 1 to 6; and (2) what provision should be made for determin-\n-ing the question of "domestic jurisdiction". It had been suggested\nat the last meeting that it might be determined by unanimous agree-\nment of members of the Security Council or the Court of International\nJustice.\n  MR. DULLES said that he had objected to this paragraph at the time\nof his discussions with Secretary of State Hull in the fall of 1944.3\nIt was, he thought, a contradiction in terms to say that a matter which\nthreatened the peace of the world was solely a matter of "domestic\njurisdicetion".\' How could this be?  We had to have limitations as\nto Section B dealing with action concerning threats- to the peace or\nacts of aggression, but the whole effect of Chapter VIII would be\ndestroyed with- such a limitation in it. The Security Council should\n-have authority to -consider any matter which threatened the peace\nof the world.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN said he thought the Charter would be better\noff without paragraph 7, but SENATOR VANDENBERG declared that\nwithout it there would be no possibility of getting the Charter ap-\nproved by the United States Senate. COMMANDER STASSEN said that\n  9 Bilateral treaties between the United States and France and between France\nand the United Kingdom regarding assistance to France in the event of un-\nprovoked aggression by Germany, signed at Versailles, June 28, 1919. The\ntreaty between the United States and France was submitted to the Senate\nJuly 29, 1919. It was not considered by the Senate and was returned to the\nSecretary of State by resolution of the Senate February 12, 1935.
