He thought that, except for that point, we should not\ndisturb the text of the amendment of the Sponsoring Governments.\nSENATOR CONNALLY expressed the view that the whole plan was based\non agreement among the Five Powers. He thought we should stick\nwith them right down the line. The Secretary stated that this dis-\ncussion was very important and believed that we could not deviate\nfrom the amendments of the Sponsoring Governments. MR. DULLES\nstated his belief that the question of re-eligibility of the Deputies had\nbeen an oversight. MR. PASVOLSKY said that it was obvious that we\nshould not change the agreements but he thought it proper to discuss\nany proposals for alteration in the amendments among the Big Five.\nHe said he would like to raise the question of the re-eligibility and\nnumber of Deputies with that Committee. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM\nstated that practically all of the small powers were opposed to the\nprovisions concerning the four Deputies and wondered why we should\nfight them on this point. It was agreed that the Delegation should\nsupport the election of the Deputies by the same method as the Secre-\ntary General, that is, election by the General Assembly on recom-\nnmendation of the Security Council. It was also agreed that the\nquestion of the number of Deputies and their eligibility for reelection\nbe discussed by the Committee of Five.\n                    NEW COURT VS. OLD COURT\n  MR. HAoKwoRi' stated that he wished to have the views of the\nDelegation on the question of the continuation of the present Court\nas against the proposal for a new Court, a matter which was to be\ndecided by a Subcommittee at 2: 30 today.55 He reported that there\nhad been considerable debate in this Subcommittee and that the posi-\ntion of the Delegation would need to be defined. He stated that the\nBritish, French, Cubans and Mexicans wanted to continue the Perma-\nnent Court of International Justice.56 The Soviet Union had ex-\npressed opposition to the continuation of the old Court. The question\ninvolved concerned the position of the 17 parties to the Statute of\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice who were not repre-\nsented at San Francisco. He said that the Chilean Delegation wanted\nto know the views of the Sponsoring Powers with regard to these 17\nmembers of the old Court. He reported that Professor Golunsky\nhad expressed the view that some neutrals should not be parties to\nthe Statute. SENATOR CONNALLY inquired whether the neutrals could\nnot be knocked out of the old Court and then readmitted.\n' Minutes of meetings of Subcommittee IV/1/A not printed; for its report\non\nthe question of continuity of the International Court, May 21, see Doe. 4-77,\nIV/1/A/1, May 22, UNCIO Documents, vol. 13, p. 524.\n56 For index to amendments, comments, and proposals on chapter VII, see Doe.\n288, G/38, May 14, ibid., vol. 3, pp. 668-671.\n756\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0819&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0817&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0819&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0818&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
