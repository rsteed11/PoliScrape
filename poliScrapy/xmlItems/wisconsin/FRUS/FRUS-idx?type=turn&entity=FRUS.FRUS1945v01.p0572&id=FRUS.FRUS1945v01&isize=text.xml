He said this was a point which\ncould be discussed further. He left with Mr. Eden a copy of his\nsuggested formula, and Mr. Eden promised to have it copied and\nsent on to Mr. Dunn the next morning.\n  2. Mr. Stettinius at one point-asked Mr.-Molotov whether it would\nbe possible for the four sponsoring Governments to complete their\nconsultations with regard to proposals of amendments or changes\nto the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals before Mr. Molotov left San Fran-\n,cisco, the American suggestions having already been presented to\n-the British, Russian, and Chinese Delegations. Mr. Molotov said\n-that he did not expect to leave until the Commissions and Committees\nof the Conference were set up and working. That would be two or\nthree days and he hoped very much that agreement could be reached\non suggested amendments among the four sponsors before he left.\n  3. Mr. Molotov himself brought up the question of Poland, and\n.said that there would be a great advance in the atmosphere of\ncooperation of the Big Powers of the Conference if some future step\ncould be taken with regard to Poland and that he hoped that some\nexchange of views while he was here would help to make some progress\nalong those lines. The Secretary said that he was looking forward\n-to discussion of this matter the next day at 11 o'clock, as already\narranged, and Mr. Eden said that he was intensely interested in the\nmatter and would be glad to take it up at that time.31\n  4. Mr. Molotov took occasion to refer to the enormous influence\nexercised by the Latin American Republics, even including the very\nsmall ones, which, he indicated, seemed, in his opinion, to have a\nvoice out of all proportion to their power and resources, merely\nby associating themselves with others in the South American group.\nThis matter was not pursued, but Mr. Molotov was plainly indicating\nhis concern at the possible control of the Conference by a bloc as\nopposed to his own conception of having the Conference controlled\nby the four Major Powers under an agreement to maintain unanimity\n-with respect to all major questions which came before the Conference.\n  These were about the only subjects of a serious political nature\nwhich arose at the dinner, as most of the conversation was on non-\ncontroversial subjects and in a tone of complete cordiality and friend-\nliness on the part of all those taking part. Immediately after the\ndinner, all the Foreign Ministers proceeded to the Opera House for\nthe evening Plenary Session,32 which was presided over by Dr. Soong,\nthe other three Ministers sitting together in the seats of the United\nKingdom Delegation. The obvious friendliness and cordiality of\ntone displayed by the three Ministers sitting in the British Delega-\ntion's seats was remarked on by all those present, including the press\n3 See memorandum of conversation, May 2, 11 a. m., vol. v, p. 272.\n'32 Doe. 58, P/15, May 2, JNCIO Documents, vol. 1, p. 498.\n&gt;510\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0572&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0572&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0572&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0572&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0572&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0572&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0572&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0571&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0573&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0571&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0573&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0572&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
