SENATOR VANDENBERG then suggested that con-\nsideration of this very important paragraph be deferred until Senator\nConnally was present. It was agreed to do this.\nChapter VIII, Section B\n  With respect to paragraph 1 of Section B, MR. PAsVOLsKY suggested\nthat the phrase "and the pro~virions of this Charter" be added,\nthus\nmaking the drafting in this paragraph conform to the language sug-\ngested for paragraph 2 of Section B of Chapter VI. It was agreed\nthat it should be adopted as a general drafting rule that this change\nshould be made elsewhere at the appropriate places in the Charter.\nWith this additional phrase, paragraph 1 was considered to be\nsatisfactory.\n  Paragraphs 2 and 3 were approved in their present form. With\nrespect to the latter, REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said he did not like the\nenumeration of measures not involving the use of armed force, but\ndid not suggest any revision in view of Mr. Pasvolsky\'s statement\nthat the enumeration had been in response to Soviet insistence.\n  It was recognized that some clarification of paragraphs 4 and 5\nmight be in order. Accordingly, it was agreed that, in the event of\ndissatisfaction on the part of other Governments, the following re-\nvisions would be agreeable to the United States Delegation:\n  With respect to paragraph 4, the redrafting of the last sentence to\nread: "Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other\noperations by air, sea or land -forces made available to the Security\nCowncil by the members of the Organization.\n  With respect to paragraph 5, the redrafting of the last sentence to\nread: "The negotiations concerning the special agreement or agree-\nments should be initiated by the Security Council as soon as possible.\nThe agreement or agreements should be subject to approval by the\nSecurity Council and to ratification by the signatory states in accord-\nance with their constitutional processes."\n  Paragraph 6 was approved. SENATOR VANDENBERG said that it was\nhis understanding of this paragraph that the forces would be supplied\n  8On January 27, 1926, the United States Senate gave its advice and consent\nto\nthe ratification of the protocol of signature subject to five reservations;\non\nSeptember 14, 1929, a protocol for the accession of the United States was\nopened\nfor signature by a conference of states signatories to the protocol; on January\n29,\n1935, by vote of 52 to 36, the Senate failed to adopt a resolution approving\nrati-\nfication of the protocol of accession by the United States.
