JESSUP observed that in line with Mr. Dulles\' comment, the\nlanguage of Chapter VIII, Section A, paragraph 6 of the Dumbarton\nOaks Proposals should be toned down, because it suggested at present\n-an obligation to refer justiciable disputes to the Court. MR. DULLEs\nstated that it might be changed to read that justiciable disputes\nshould be referred to the Court "if the parties have agreed.\' COM\nMANDER STASSEN noted that in-theory the countries have to agree to\naction under the Security Council, with respect to the pacific settle-\nment of disputes, although he thought that there might actually be\n,;some element of compulsion involved.\n       NOMINATION OF JUDGES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT\n  MR. HJACKWORTH explained to the Delegation the present system for\nthe nomination and election of the judges of the Permanent Court of\nInternational Justice. He stated that the method of making nomi-\nnations under the present Statute was somewhat complex, but this\nis a result of a determined effort made by the Committee of Jurists\nwho drew up the original Statute in 1920 to avoid as far as possible\nthe making of selection on the basis of political considerations. Nomi-\nnations under the present Statute are made by the national groups on\nthe panel of the old Hague Court of Arbitration under the Conven-\ntions of 1899 and 1907.90 These national groups (composed of four\npersons in each country) meet and nominate jurists for election to\nthe Court. MR. HACKWORTH stated that no group may nominate more\nthan four persons, not more than two of whom shall be of their own\nnationality; nor may it nominate more than two persons for the same\nvacancy. MR. HACKWORTII then said that the British representative\nat the Washington meeting had proposed that each government nomi-\nnate one of its own nationals, and the Judges would be elected from this\nlist.9\'\n  MR. HACKWORTH stated that there was a sharp division of.view on\nthis matter in Washington and that sixteen countries had favored. the\nBritish proposal while sixteen others favored retention of the present\nsystem.92 MR. HACKWORTII recalled that this had been discussed in\nthe United States Delegation in Washington, and that in accordance\nwith the Delegation\'s instructions, Chief Justice Strong and Chief\nJustice Hughes had been consulted. Both emphatically felt that the\npresent system was better than having direct nominations by govern-\nments. It was felt that while the United States might try to select\nthe best man, other nations might nominate politicians rather than\njurists. MR. HACKWORTH stated, therefore, that in the Committee of\n  9 Department of State Treaty Series Nos. 392 and 536,- respectively, or\n32 Stat.\n(pt. 2) 1779 and 36 Stat.
