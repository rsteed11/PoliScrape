Thus, the precedents created under the Statute of\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice would be appropriate\nunder the new statute.\n  He thought the sole question was whether there was any advantage\nin changing the name of the court. He noted that it was true that\nthe American Bar Association preferred the old court and the o1d\nname; but he observed that most of those American Bar Association\ndiscussions had been in terms of American adherence to a World\nCourt, without emphasis on-the name of the court.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked if the old court had not been named\nin numerous treaties as the forum to which various matters should\nbe submitted. MR. FAHY replied that that could be covered by a\nprovision in the United Nations Charter to the effect that wherever\nthe Permanent Court- of International Justice was referred to in\ntreaties, the new court should be deemed to be the court referred to.\nHe stated that this would leave a question as to treaties in which one\nof the parties was not a member of the United Nations. However,\nhe thought that this problem would exist even if the name of the old\ncourt were retained, since states not members of the United Nations\nmight not be parties to the new statute.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked if it were Mr. Fahy's view that the name\nof the court were the only point of divergence. MR. FAHY replied\nthat, one difficulty he had with respect to the old Statute wyas that it\nreally would not be the old Statute if it were modified. He did not\nthink this was a critical point however.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG thought that the Delegation should give\nMr. Hackworth the option to proceed in either direction with respect\nto the statute. SENATOR CONNALLY asked if the Delegation- should\nhear the American Bar Association on this matter. MR. HACKWORTH\nreported that Mr. Simmons' 37 attitude was that the American Bar\nAssociation would accept whatever the Delegation would decide here\nat San Francisco.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY thought that the idea of continuity, especially\nwith regard to judicial matters, is entitled to some weight. He\nthought it would be desirable if we could retain the old organization\nwith pertinent modifications. COMMANDER STASSEN observed that\nthere was no basic difference between the two positions. He thought\nthat with regard to the old court, there was an asset in its precedents,\nan asset in its statute, and an asset in the fact that numerous countries\nhad signed treaties referring matters to the court. On the other hand,\nthe old court had the liability that there are countries now in it that\nwe do not want in it; and also the fight over the old court in this\n7 David A.
