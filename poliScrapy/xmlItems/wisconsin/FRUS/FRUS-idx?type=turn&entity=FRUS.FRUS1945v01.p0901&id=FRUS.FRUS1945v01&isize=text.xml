In submitting this revised text of Alternative II\nto the Delegation, THE SECRETARY expressed approval of Mr. Pasvol-\nsky\'s proposals. SENATOR CONNALLY thought that reference to full em-\nployment in this context was satisfactory. SENATOR VANDENBERG\nthought it was lousy. MR. DULLES wondered whether the principle\nof non-intervention in domestic affairs was affected by this text.\nMR. PASVOLSKY pointed out that under the amendments proposed in\nCommittee II/3 the clause on domestic jurisdiction might nullify the\nmeaning of the proposal, but under the wording as now accepted by\nthe Delegation the clause on domestic jurisdiction would not affect it.\n  MR. STINEIOWER then raised the question of the draft proposed by\nCommittee II/3 concerning the clause "all members pledge themselves\nto take separate and joint action to achieve the purposes etc." and\ninquired whether the Delegation considered that the pledge goes too\nfar. SENATOR CONNALLY thought that the phrase "take action" went\ntoo far. MR. DuNN considered that if this were restricted to the\ninternational field it would not affect the clause on domestic jurisdic-\ntion. SENATOR CONNALLY wondered how it was possible to separate\naction in the international field which would not affect domestic\nquestions. MR. ROCKEFELLER agreed with Senator Connally\'s obser-\nvation. SENATOR VANDENBERG asked what an International WPA 54\nwas. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE thought that the change was not serious\nand that our Delegation would be unpopular if we opposed the\nchanges which had been proposed.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY thought that a statement "to cooperate with each\nother and with the Organization" was the only one that made sense\nand that the phrase "take separate and joint action" should not\nbe\napproved. THE SECRETARY supported this view and the Delegation\nagreed that the phrase "to take separate and joint action" should\nbe\ndeleted and the phrase "cooperate with each other and with the\nOrganization" should be retained.\n                      RETURN OF MR. GATES\n   THE SECRETARY welcomed the presence of Mr. Gates and stated that\nthere had been a long series of meetings on the regional question and\nthat the matter had been disposed of satisfactorily. MR. GATEs stated\nthat the Admirals had been satisfied with the text which had been\nagreed to.55 THE SECRETARY stated that he wished to apologize to the\nrepresentatives of the Army and Navy for the failure of the adminis-\ntrative units of the Delegation to send them the documents which\nthey should have had. He said that an investigation had already been\n  \' Works Progress Administration.\n  55 For text of statement by the Secretary of State on proposals submitted\nto the\n  Regional Committee, released to the press at San Francisco on May 20, see\n  Department of State Bulletin, May 27, 1945, p. 949; see also Doe. 533,\nIII/4/A/9,\n  May 23, UNCIO Documents, vol. 12, p. 848.\n      723-681-67  57\n839\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0901&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0901&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0901&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0901&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0901&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0901&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0901&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0900&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0902&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0900&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0902&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0901&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
