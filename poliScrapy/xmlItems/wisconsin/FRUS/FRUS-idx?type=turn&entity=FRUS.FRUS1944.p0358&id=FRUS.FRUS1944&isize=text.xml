The state of preparation for\nsuch a conference, however, was not sufficiently advanced, and it was\nonly at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 that agreement was\nreached to convene such a conference in April 1945. See Foreign Rela-\ntioins, The Conferences at Malta and Yalta, 1945, p. 971.\n  11. Territorial settlements in central and southeastern Europe. For\na memorandum prepared by the Archduke Otto of Austria on a con-\nversation which he had with Roosevelt at Quebec on September 15,\n1944, see post, p. 367. According to this memorandum, Roosevelt told\nthe Archduke that the President and Churchill had noted, in working\non their papers at the Quebec Conference, that Austria and Hungary\n"would of all countries undergo the least territorial changes".\nTran-\nsylvania seems to have been discussed specifically by Roosevelt and\nChurchill, and also the importance of keeping the Communists out of\nHungary and Austria. The discussion of these questions presumably\ntook place in the light of the armistice with Rumania, which was\nsigned at Moscow early on September 13, 1944 while Roosevelt and\nChurchill were at Quebec.                  I\n  12. British meat purchases from Argentina. For two memoranda by\nHull on this subject which Roosevelt gave to Churchill at Quebec, see\npost, pp. 393, 394. Roosevelt\'s representations to Churchill on this mat-\nter, presumably at Quebec, are also mentioned in post-Conference corre-\nspondence relating to a contract for the purchase of Argentine meat\nby the United Kingdom. See Foreign Relations, 1944, vol. VII, pp.\n362-363. Morgenthau told a group of his colleagues in the Treasury\nDepartment on September 19, 1944, that "the question of the Argen-\ntine" had come up in his hearing at Quebec, but that he had said noth-\ning on the subject. (Morgenthau Diary, vol. 772)\n  13. Publication of the Phillips report on India. On July 25, 1944,\nthe British Minister at Washington (Campbell) had protested the\npublication, in Drew Pearson\'s "The Washington Merry-Go-Round"\ncolumn of that date, of a large part of the text of a confidential report\nof May 14, 1943, from Ambassador William Phillips to Roosevelt,\nand the "leak" of this report had been a matter of continued discussion\nbetween United States and British officials in the period before the\nSecond Quebec Conference. See Foreign Relations. 1944, vol. V, pp.\n239-247. Phillips called on Roosevelt in Washington on September 30,\n1944, at which time Roosevelt told him that he had taken the matter\nup at Quebec and considered it finished. (Memorandum, Gray to Hull,\nSeptember 30,1944, 851.00/9-3044)\n  14. Indochina and the French role in Far Eastern military opera-\ntions. For pre-Conference memoranda which Hull submitted to Roose-\nvelt on these subjects, see, ante, pp. 249, 261. On January 1, 1945, Roo-\nsevelt informed Hull that he still did "not want to get mixed up in\nany\nIndochina decision" or "in any military effort toward the liberation\nof\nIndochina from the Japanese"; that he had "made this very clear\nto Mr.\nChurchill", presumably at the Quebec Conference; and that action\nwas premature from both military and civil points of view.
