SENATOR VANDENBERG agreed and thought that the proper\nthing to do would be to have the chief delegates of each Delegation ap-\npear in Committee II/2 when this question was under discussion.\n  MR. PASVOLsKY asked whether the question would be settled during\nthe day and THE SECRETARY replied that it would be considered at the\n9: 30 meeting of the five powers.\n                          TRUSTEESHIP\n  THE SECRETARY reported to the Delegation that the Trusteeship\nchapter had been accepted by Committee 11/4 on the previous eve-\nning.19 The Secretary thought that the Delegation owed a debt of\ngratitude to Commander Stassen for the fine job he had done during\nthe negotiations on this very difficult chapter. COMMANDER STASSEN\nsaid that it was particularly gratifying to him that the meeting of\nCommittee 11/4 the previous evening had ended up most satisfactorily\nwith all the delegates congratulating each other.

The Greeks had\nasked Mr. Hickerson how they should vote on this matter, and he had\nreplied that it would be necessary to take the matter up in the Dele-\ngation. Mr. Hickerson had made it clear, however, that this Gov-\nernment did not like Franco Spain. MR. HICKERSON observed that\nhis recommendation would be that the Delegate of the United States\non Commission I be authorized to vote in favor of such a resolution if\nit were proposed. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM urged that a more satis-\nfactory course would be to use parliamentary procedure to have the\nmatter thrown out without any vote being taken. MR.
