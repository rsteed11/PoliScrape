BONCOtR stated at this point that he accepted the text of the\nproposal on behalf of the French Delegation.\n  AMBASSADOR GROMYKO said that he considered that it would be\nexpedient to present the proposal after the end of the consultation,\nthat is after each government had given its official reply. For the\nSoviet Delegation he would remark that he had noticed on reading\nthe document for the first time that there were certain deviations in\nit from the principles agreed upon at Dumbarton Oaks. He had com-\nmunicated the text to his Government but had not received a reply.\nAs soon as he had received instructions from his Government he\nwould inform Mr. Stettinius.\n  MR. BONCOUR asked Ambassador Gromyko whether he could spe-\ncifically state in what respects the proposal differed from the Dum-\nbarton Oaks Proposals. AMBASSADOR GROMYKO said that he did not\nwish to take up a detailed discussion of the provisions but that he\nwould say that it deviated from the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals in\npermitting any organization to act independently of the Security\nCouncil.\n  AMBASSADOR Koo recalled that he had said previously that his first\nimpression, in light of all the circumstances, was that the present\nformula offered a fair and happy solution. This impression had been\nconfirmed by further study. In response to a direct question from\nMr. Stettinius as to whether the Chinese Delegation was prepared\nto support the proposal, AMBASSADOR Koo said that it was.\n  At this point MR. STEWrNIuS asked Mr. Hiss to comment on the\nproblem of expediting the work of the Conference. He said that\nhe thought this was relevant to the matter under discussion.\n  MR. Hiss recalled that he had spoken at the meeting last Saturday 65\nof a plan for having certain amendments eliminated and others con-\nsolidated. He said that this work had not progressed very far. He\nhad had reports from the secretaries of the various Committees in-\ndicating that the Delegations of the five powers had not pressed this\nprocedure. Mr. Hiss thought that the steps to expedite the work was\nespecially important in Committees 1 and 2 of Commission II and\nCommittees 1, 2, and 3 of Commission III. He asked that the Dele-\ngates of the five powers press this point in these Committees. He\nsaid that the consolidation in question had been carried out and that\nthe secretaries were ready to produce the necessary materials on\nrequest.\n  MR. BONCOR fully shared Mr. Hiss' views on the necessity for ex-\npediting the work of the Conference. He referred to the experience\nin his own Committee 66 as showing the need for this.\n5Third Five-Power informal consultative meeting.
