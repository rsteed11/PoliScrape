He noted that the question of the signing by either of the\nSoviet republics or Argentina of the United Nations Declaration had\nnot been raised at any time by any one. He explained that Mr. Molo-\ntov had pled that the seating of the Polish Government be linked with\nthe seating of Argentina and the two Soviet republics, but that we\nhad stood our ground. He explained that what Mr. Molotov had\nsaid in the Steering and Executive Committees was practically the\nsame as what he had said in the afternoon.\n  The Latin American states, he felt, had behaved extremely well in\nvoting for the admission of the two Soviet republics to the Conference\nbefore receiving a commitment on Argentina. The admission of the\ntwo Soviet republics, he explained, had been unanimously passed in\nthe Executive and Steering Committees. In these committees Mr.\nMolotov had attempted to block the seating of Argentina until the\nLublin Poles were admitted, but there was great resentment at this,\nand when it was put to a vote, Mr. Molotov was overwhelmingly voted\ndown. THE SECRETARY stated that it had been the general feeling\nthat the business was then completed on these two questions. In fact,\nhe had received permission to announce the action of the Executive\nand the Steering Committees to the press. He had felt that the major\nhurdle had been cleared and that the Conference could now settle\ndown to its serious business. However, MNa. MOLOTrOv had arisen in\nthe Plenary Session and had made a long speech against the seating\nof Argentinia.' This was followed by several Latin American speakers\nwho urged the admission of Argentina. The question was then up\nto be thoroughly thrashed out in the Plenary Session. He explained\nthat he himself had finally pled that the matter be disposed of\npromptly, that the log jam was finally broken, and another vote taken\nwhich was substantially the same vote as in the Steering Committee.\nThe motion of admission of Argentina to the Conference was approved\n31 to 4.\n  THE SECRETARY explained that the representatives of the two Soviet\nrepublics had already asked for visas and that he had wired that they\n-should be granted.4\n  THE SECRETARY commented that no one could tell whether the Polish\nsettlement would come up again, but that we were taking the position\nthat this question upon which agreement had been reached at Yalta\nwas still in consultation and did not belong in the Conference.\n'See Doc. 42, P/10, May 1, UNCIO Documents, vol. I, p. 343.\n  In telegrams 15, 16, and 17, May 1, to the Acting Secretary of State,\nthe Secretary-General (Hiss) requested that the Department inform the Govern,-\nments of Argentina, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Byelo-\nrussian Soviet Socialist Republic that the Conference in plenary session\non\nApril 30 had resolved that, having decided that those Republics would be\ninvited\nto be initial members of the proposed international organization, the representa-\ntives be invited to take their seats at the Conference immediately (500.CC/5-\n145).\n501\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0563&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0563&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0563&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0563&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0563&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0563&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0563&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0562&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0564&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0562&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0564&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0563&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
