General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 238\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\n  2. LoRD HALIFAX said that, because of its tri-partite nature the\nInternational Labor Organization has a special character making it\nsomewhat different from the other bodies.89 He, therefore, suggested\nthat while the other bodies might be invited to send two or three rep-\nresentatives, it would be preferable in the case of the ILO to invite\nit to send four or five representatives. THE SECRETARY and THE\nCHINESEo AMBASSADOR agreed. [The SOVIET AMBASsADOR said that he\nwould like to consult his Government on this subject.] 90\nAmendments\n  MIR. mss stated the Soviet position that no amendments should be\neither proposed or, spported without the agreement of the sponsors.\nMR. HISS also reported that the Chinese Ambassador had asked\nwhether the American proposal referred only to matters brought up\nbefore the Conference as a whole or whether it also applied to dis-\ncussions in the committees."\' To that question Mr. Hiss had replied\nthat the Department\'s feeling was that the four sponsoring powers\nshould consult regarding formal proposals put forward by any one\nof them in any organ of the Conference, but that this suggestion would\nnot apply to informal statements in commission or committee dis-\ncussions. LoRD HALIFAX said that his Government agrees with the\ngeneral purpose behind the United States and Soviet proposals, but\nthat in the British view it would be preferable that there should be no\nrigid rule. The four sponsoring governments should not feel obliged\nto consult and agree on unimportant proposals for changes in the\nDumbarton Oaks drafts, but they should feel bound to consult before\nmaking any major proposals for change, or before accepting any\nmajor changes suggested by others. MR. GROmyKO amplified this\nthought by stating that the delegations of the four sponsoring powers\nshould consult on proposals made by any country (a) which would\nchange [directly or would affect indirectly] 92 the character of the\nDumbarton Oaks Proposals, or (b) which were important in other\nrespects. With this statement THE SECRETARY, LoRDI HALIFAX and the\nCmHNESE AMBASSADOR agree. THE SECRETARY added the thought that\nthis is not an advance agreement to agree but simply to consult. MR.\nGRoTTxo said that he hoped that the sponsors would always work in\nclose accord.\n" The International Labor Organization affords direct representation\nto Gov-\nernments as well as employers and workers.\n  " Insertion within brackets, written on original copy, made In accordance\nwith a request by the Soviet Ambassador In his letter of April 12 (not found\nIn\nDepartment files);
