General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 44\n\n\nFOREIGN REELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\n  TmH AMBASSADOR OF CHILE repeated the recommendation of his\nGovernment,84 that the primary responsibility of the Security Coun-\ncil for the maintenance of international peace and security be vested\nin the Council only during the periods when the Assembly was not in\nsession.\n  Further discussion of paragraph 4 was deferred until consideration\nof the Court should be started.\n  In connection with paragraph 5, DR. PASVOLSKY called upon Gen-\neral Strong,85 who explained that the problem of trying to specify\nall regulations of armaments was extremely complicated, involving as\nit did, considerations of such matters as production, distribution, use,\ncharacter, and size of armaments. He said that considerations of what\nwould constitute the field of armaments had for years plagued the\nLeague. Therefore, for the purposes of the Dumbarton Oaks Pro-\nposals, it had been decided that it would be much better to plan for a\nsystem of regulation and leave to the conference when called the de-\ncision as to limitations to be imposed in that particular field.86\n  As regards the additional paragraphs 6, 7, and 8, proposed in the\nChilean memorandum (the first two of which had already been cov-\nered in general terms), it was decided, since paragraph 8 deals with\nthe obligations to provide armed forces, requiring special agreements.\nthat discussion of this point should be postponed. The same decision\nwas made regarding the additional paragraph 9 on nonparticipation\nof members. It was also felt that Panama\'s comment on Section B\nas a whole did not require any discussion.\n  IDR. PASVOLSKY explained that the Venezuelan comment 87 on Sec-\ntion B as a whole related to the long statement he had made before\non the distribution of power between the Assembly and the Council\nand that obviously the whole question would have to be considered\nas a part of the broad problem of distribution of powers.\n  It was agreed that discussion of Section C, Voting, would be pre-\nmature at this time.\n  With reference to Section D, Procedure, DR. PASVOLSKY stated\nthat the first point had already been discussed together with the\nobservations made by the governments of Mexico and Venezuela.\n  "4For text of memorandum from the Chilean Embassy, December 11, 1944,\ntransmitting the comments of the Chilean Government on the Dumbarton Oaks\nProposals, see doe. 2, G7(i), May 2, UNCIO Documents, vol. 3, p. 282.\n  \' Maj.
