General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 985\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE9\nPASVOLSKY remarked that this Delegation seemed to think that the\nchange was foolish and did not accomplish anything. The Euro-\npean states seemed to think that the change was necessary.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN declared he would make a compromise with\nMr. Pasvolsky. THE COMMANDER declared he would accept the\nchange if Mr. Pasvolsky could have the words "a state enemy of the\nUnited Nations in this war" defined as to refer specifically to Ger-\nmany, and MR. PASVOLSKY replied that this would be impossible.\nCOMMANDER STASSEN remarked that the change, in his opinion,\ngranted broader freedom of action to the European countries and he\nwanted this broader wording narrowed down so that it would refer\nonly to Germany.\n  THE SECRETARY asked what action the Delegation wished to take.\nHe thought that everyone must thoroughly understand Commander\nStassen\'s position by this time. SENATOR VANDENBERG urged that\nit would be dangerous to leave the question open any longer and THE\nSECRETARY asked Commander Stassen whether he would agree to\nreach a decision on the question during that meeting. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN agreed to this suggestion. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM urged\nthat an agreement should be reached with the other members of the\nBig Five that the rest of the paragraph should not be reopened as\na result of the consideration of the French amendment. He was of\nthe opinion that the discussion in the Committee did not constitute\nan adequate guarantee. SENATOR VANDENBERG declared that this was\npart of the proposal on which the Delegation was acting. MR. DUNN\ndeclared that that was the agreement-that the United States would\nsupport the amendment if it was clear that no other changes would\nbe made. REPRESENTATIVE BLoox declared that he favored this posi-\ntion and REPRESENTATIVE EATON indicated that he would go along\nwith "Senator" Bloom.\n  THE SECRETARY remarked that he hated to reach the decision on\nthis important position in view of COMMANDER STAsSEN\'s strong oppo-\nsition. The latter declared that the matter was entirely up to the\ndecision of the Delegation but that he would have to dissent. The\nFour Powers, -he declared, had reached an agreement in conformity\nwith the original position of the military representatives. This word-\ning, he thought, should not be amended at all. REPRESENTATIVn\nBLOOM recommended that in view of the fact that the Delegation had\nbeen able to achieve unanimity on all questions thus far, and with\nconsideration for Commander Stassen\'s strong feelings on the sub-\nject, the final decision of this question be postponed until the follow-\ning meeting. SENATOR CONNALLY declared that unless the matter\nwere decided soon, it would become a, "festering- sore", but REPRE-\nSENTATIVE BLooM urged that it would not fester in 24 hours.
