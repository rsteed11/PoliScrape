General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 555\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CON FERENCE\nbut that it would have no power to undo treaties, and that it was\nclear that the recommendation would not go to the Security Council,\nwhich would have no power in this respect. He agreed thoroughly\nwith the idea of having a forum for the consideration of this question.\nHe would not be willing to give either organization the power to\ncall nations in and say, "Here, your treaty is wrong." He said\nthat\nmaking the reference in the Preamble suggested by Mr. Eden was\nagreeable to him.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said that if Mr. Molotov wished a statement\nmade regarding the reasons for the proposal under discussion he would\nbe very glad to make it. AM. MOLOTOV said he would like to hear the\nstatement. SENATOR VANDENBERG said that we are constantly told\nthat all of this latitude for investigation and report by the Assembly\nalready exists in the broad language of the Duinbarton Oaks Pro-\nposals, to which all the sponsoring powers have agreed. If this is\ntrue, it seemed to the Senator that there could be no objection to mak-\ning it specific. If there is objection, it lends dangerous weight to\ncritics of Dumbarton Oaks to [wiho] deny -that the pow er is already\nimplicit. Frankly, he was thinking of critics in the United States\nSenate who have already indicated this as their line of attack on the\nCharter. These critics say that the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals freeze\nthe post war world in a rigid pattern created by expedient decisions\nmade during the war. In addition there will be future decisions at the\npeace table of which we are not now cognizant. They are asking our\npeople to underwrite the unknown even with the lives of our soldiers\nand our sons. They say we are not exploring the opportunity of cor-\nrecting our mistakes by specific means, but the only way to do it is\nby the use of armed forces at our disposal.\n  THE SENATOR said that he wanted to add this personal appeal. He\nwas in a very peculiar position-representing the minority side of\nthe Senate. It was from that side of the Senate that the votes must\nbe produced for the ratification of the Charter. He wanted to produce\nthem. He was precisely in the position of Prime Minister Churchill\nwhen he said "If you will give me the tools, I will give you the re-\nsults".7\' This provision in Paragraph 6 was the tool the Senator\nhad to have.\n  MR. MOLOTOV said that his first question was whether the American\nDelegation agreed with the views expressed by Senator Vandenberg.\nMR. STETTINIUS said that as Chairman of the United States Delegation\nhe could say that this was the Delegation\'s unanimous view.\n  MR. MOLOTOV said he would like to know exactly what text was\nbeing discussed-the British proposal or the United States draft.\n  7\' "Give us the tools, and we will finish the job", was the concluding\nsentence\nin a world broadcast, February 9, 1941, printed in The War Speeches of the\nlRt.\n?on. W7inston S. Churchill, compiled by Charles Eade (London, Cassell &amp;\nCo.\nLtd., 1951), vol. i, p. 343.\n555\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0617&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0617&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0617&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0617&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0617&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0617&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0617&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0616&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0618&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0616&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0618&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0617&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
