General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 751\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFDRENCE\nin major agreements with the Latin American countries and thought\nopposition on the part of the United States to the insertion of a sim-\nilar provision in the Charter would be unfortunate.44 MIR. PASVOL-\nsKY stated that it was difficult to draft a statement upon which agree-\nment could be reached. He added that an attempt had been made\nat Dumbarton Oaks 45 to find a satisfactory formula but that none\nhad been found. COMMANDER STASSEN moved that the Delegation\naccept the decision of the Committee of Five to oppose reference to\nnon-intervention anywhere in\'the Charter. It was so agreed.\n  MR. PAsVOLSKY read the text of recommendation (e) concerning the\nenumeration of human rights. He pointed out that this question\nwould come up in connection with the Ukrainian amendment on the\nright to work.46 THE SECRETARY observed that if any recommendation\nnot to enumerate human rights was agreed to, it would eliminate the\npossibility of the proposal for a free flow of information. CoM-\nMANDER STASSEN suggested that if the Ukrainian Delegation insists\non its proposal concerning the right to work we could then insist upon\nadding to the list such rights as the free flow of information, freedom\nof worship, and others. The Delegation agreed that there should be\nno enumeration of human rights in the form of a declaration, nor in\nan extended preamble, nor under a specific provision for the prepara-\ntion of a Bill of Rights, in accordance with the recommendation of\nthe Committee of Five.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY then read item (f) as follows: "Modification of\nPrinciple 4 to the effect that the pledge of the members to refrain in\ntheir -iuternational relations from use of force would apply solely\nto force \'not approved by the Security Council\'. It is recommended\nthat this change be opposed, in accordance with the recommendation\nof the Committee of Five." He pointed out that the amendment in\nquestion under this paragraph had been proposed by Norway and\nthat it was primarily a verbal change. MR. DumLEs observed that\nthis was a very bad recommendation because it was contrary to the\nprovision concerning self-defense. MR. PASVOLSKY observed that\nforce could be used with the approval of the Council and be used\nindependently by states. COMMANDER STASSEN moved disapproval\nof the recommendation. It was then agreed that this recommenda-\ntion be disapproved in the form stated.\n  The Delegation approved without discussion recommendation (g)\nwhich reads as follows: "Modification of Principle 5 to exempt states\n44 See amendments proposed with respect to chapter II by Latin American\nStattes, UNCIO Documents, vol. 6, pp. 557-568 (Doc. 215, I/1/10, May 11).\n\' See the following documentation on the Dumbarton Oaks Conversations:\nProgress report No. 17 and extract from minutes of the Joint Steering Committee\nmeeting No. 12, both of September 9;
