NOR said there were three alternatives now before the Dele-\ngates (a) this question could come up in Committee I/2 and the United\nStates could change its vote there; (b) we could move for a recon-\nsideration in Committee 11/1; or (c) we could let it go to Committee\nIII/1 which had jurisdiction over the question of voting in the Secu-\nrity Council. COMMANDER STASSEN said he thought the Coordination\nCommittee could clear up any inconsistencies when the votes came in\nfrom other Committees. He was sure there would be numerous in-\nstances of conflict and inconsistency. He thought that Representa-\ntive Bloom and Dean Gildersleeve were working along the right lines\nin attempting to win the maximum support and gain as many friends\nas possible, and then to iron out any difficulties in making the final\ndraft in the Steering Committee.\n  MR. NourER said that the Committee of Five has been justified in\nraising the question about the action of the United States in this\nCommittee because it had been agreed that each of the Delegations\nwould consult with the others on such matters. He wondered if there\nmight not be consultation among the Delegates of the Five Powers\nduring the committee meetings. It was a bad situation, in a vote on\na proposal to which all had agreed ahead of time, to have the United\nKingdom abstain, the U.S.S.R. vote no, and China and the United\nStates voting together on the other side. REPRESENTATIVE BLoM\nreplied that it would be the worst possible thing to do to call for a\nconsultation among the Delegates of the five big powers during the\ncourse of a committee meeting. COMMANDER STASSEN and DIN\nGILDERSLEEVE agreed with Representative Bloom on this point. Rhar-\nRESENTATIVFE BLOOM said that sometimes a division among the big\npowers was not a bad thing, especially when a vote was being forced.\nHe asked Mr. Kotschnig, who was assisting him in this Committee,\nto comment further.\n  MR. KoTsCHNIG said that the Committee voted down the Honduran\nproposal that the Secretary General should be elected by the Assembly\nwithout recommendation or confirmation of the Security Council.\nThe Australian Delegation had withdrawn its amendment ["subject\nto confirmation by a majority of any seven members of the Security\nCouncil and a majority of ten members of the Economic and Social\ncouncil"\']. Then they came to the Mexican proposal ["upon nomina-\ntion by a simple majority of the members of the Security Council"]].\nIt looked as though this proposal might carry if put to a vote. On\nthe basis of the discussion of the meeting of the Delegates that morn-\ning, Representative Bloom had proposed that this proposal be\nchanged to a "majority of seven members of the Security Council."\n  MR. SANDIFER said that this problem would have to be left for solu-\ntion to the Coordination Committee. It would of course come up in\nCommittee III/1. He suggested, further, that a representative of the\n     723-68@1-67-51\n743\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0805&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0805&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0805&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0805&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0805&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0805&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0805&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0804&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0806&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0804&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0806&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0805&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
