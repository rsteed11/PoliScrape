The statement\nalso indicated that we had received no suggestions from the other\nUnited Nations as to postponement. (Statement by Secretary of\nState Edward R. Stettinitis, Jr., April 3, 1945, No. 291 &#182;\n     UNOFFICIAL REPRESENTATION OF NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS\n  THE SECRETARY suggested that consideration be given next to the\nrevised List of National Organizations (April 3, 1945) 79 which was\ndistributed to the members of the Delegation with the agenda and\ntheir copies of Book 3, Comments and Suggestions on the Dumbarton\nOaks Proposals.80\n            WELCOMING STATEMENTS TO THE ADVISERS\n  Tm SECRETARY on behalf of the delegates, welcomed the advisers\nto the important undertaking that lay ahead of all of them . . .\n  TH  SECRETARY indicated that the delegates would count heavily on\nthis impressive group of advisers, and that, since the responsibilities\nof all would be so heavy, it had been decided to divide into groups so\nthat all persons would not need to keep in touch at all times with the\nentire subject matter. Each delegate and adviser would therefore\nbe active on certain subjects. TmH SECRETARY said that the group of\nadvisers was a very important one. It would meet regularly as a\ngroup and would receive full documentation from the Department\nstaff. TiE SECRETARY asked Mr. Hiss to see that proper arrangements\nwere made for a meeting of the advisers in the near future. He said\nthat the delegation itself would start its regular meetings on April 9\nand would continue them almost to the opening of the Conference.\n7 Department of State Bulletin, April 8, 1945, p. 608.\n7 Not printed.\n8 A looseleaf compilation (kept up to date) of text of the Dumbarton Oaks\nProposals on white paper, the comments and suggestions by other Governments\non green paper, and comments and suggestions emerging from discussion in\nthe\nUnited States by public officials and private groups and individuals on pink\npaper; not printed.
