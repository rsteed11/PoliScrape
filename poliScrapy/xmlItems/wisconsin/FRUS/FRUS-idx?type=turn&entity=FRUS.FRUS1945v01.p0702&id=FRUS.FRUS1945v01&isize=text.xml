General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 640\n\n\n6FOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nBOWMAN thought it was very important for the Secretary to be thor-\noughly briefed on this question since in his view it was at the heart\nof the whole problem.\n  THE SECRETARY asked that a further statement be prepared by Mr.\nHickerson and his assistants for the use by the Secretary in talking\nwith Mr. Molotov. Agreement was reached that Mr. Stassen, Sen-\nator Connally and Senator Vandenberg, Mr. Pasvolsky, Mr. Dulles,\nMr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Bowman would join the Secretary in his\ntalks with the Latin American representatives at 9: 00 a. m; the next\nmorning.\n  MR. MCCLOY took issue with Mr. Pasvolsky's suggestion, and urged\nthat we present the problem before us to Mr. Molotov as our own and\nnot as a problem raised by the Latin American countries. The Sec-\nretary thought we should sleep on this question, but that he person-\nally preferred at this time raising the issue in connection with the\ndiscussion of the proposals by other governments. MR. ROCKEFELLER\nthought that it was safer to be perfectly honest in this matter, and\nMR. MOCLOY agreed that any other tack would arouse suspicion.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY added that we were now through with the period\nof defining the amendments of the Big Four and had come to the\nperiod for the discussion of the proposals of other governments, It\nwas then perfectly natural to raise our problem in connection with\nthe discussion of these other proposals. MR. PASVOLSKY said he in-\ntended to raise this question as the number one problem in the sub-\ncommittee appointed by the Big Five that afternoon.\n  THE SECRETARY asked that Mr. Dunn speak immediately to Mr.\nGromyko, explaining that the Secretary would want to see Mr. Molo-\ntov before he left.\n  MR. STASSEN asked for the consent of the Delegation to the holding\nof a press conference by Mr. Bloom and himself to give background\ninformation on trusteeship. He noted that there was considerable\ndemand for such a press conference. The request was granted.\n  The Secretary adjourned the meeting at 7: 30 p. m.\n500.CC/5-745 Telegram\nThe Acting Secretary of State to the Minister in Iceland (Dreyfue)\n                               WASHINGTON, May 7, 1945-7 p. m.\n  75. In telephone conversations during the past few days the Minis-\nter of Iceland has urged upon officers of the Department the admission\nof Iceland to the San Francisco Conference on the grounds that several\nstates have been admitted subsequent to the original March 1 dead-\nline.
