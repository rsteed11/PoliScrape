General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 125\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nobjected to India or such small countries as Haiti, Liberia and Para-\nguay being invited to the Conference although they are not in diplo-\nmatic relations with the SovietI Union. We understand that a similar\naide-menmoire has been delivered to the British Government.\n  We propose to instruct Harriman to inform Molotov that this Gov-\nernment could not agree to an invitation being extended to the Pro-\nvisional Polish Government now acting in Warsaw" as we believe\nthat such action would make even more difficult the establishment of\nthe Provisional Government of National Unity on the broad demo-\ncratic basis that was agreed to at the Crimea Conference.58 He will\nbe authorized to state that we share Mr. Molotov\'s views as to the\nimportance of having Poland represented at San Francisco and con-\nsider this an additional reason for expediting the formation of the\nProvisional Government of National Unity. Harriman will be in-\nstructed to point out that the case of the countries mentioned by\nMr. Molotov which are not in diplomatic relation with the Soviet\nUnion would not appear to be parallel as there are no rival govern-\nments of these countries recognized by any of the United Nations.\nIn the event that a new Government has not been formed before the\nSan Francisco Conference, the Soviet and American Governments\nwould be in the position of recognizing different Polish Govern-\nments and the view of this Government is that Poland could not in\nthese circumstances be represented. The United States Government\nwould be agreeable, however, to the issuance of an invitation if the\nnew Government should be formed while the San Francisco Confer-\nence is still in session.\n  Please discuss the foregoing with the ForOf and inform the Dept\nurgently of the British views. Please inform Schoenfeld.\n  Repeated to Moscow as Depts 610.\n                                                        STmEMrNIuS\n500.CC/3-1645\n   Memworanduim by the Secretary of State to President Roosevelt\n                                    [WASHINGTON,] March 16, 1945.\n  I have had a long talk with Senator Vandenberg as a result of\nwhich he has expressed his willingness to go along with us 100% on\nthe world security organization 59 if we can work into the document\n  6 See telegram 3117, March 26, 7 p. m., from London, p. 159.\n  9 Senator Vandenberg wrote to President Roosevelt on February 15 (two days\nafter the White House announced the names of persons to be invited to be\nmem-\nbers of the American delegation to the San Francisco Conference) inquiring\nas\nto his freedom of action as a member of the American delegation, and President\nRoosevelt responded on March 3 as follows:\n  "Dear Arthur: Of course, I expect you freely to present your views\nto your\nAmerican colleagues in respect to all problems at San Francisco.
