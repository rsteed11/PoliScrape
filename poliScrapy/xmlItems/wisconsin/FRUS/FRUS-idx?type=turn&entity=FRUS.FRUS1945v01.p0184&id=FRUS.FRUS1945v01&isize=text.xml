I told the President of the\n2120,000,000 appropriation that Parliament had made for Colonial\nDevelopment over the next ten years, and gave him some little detail\nof the debate in Parliament (February 7, 1945).50\n                           TRuSTEESHIP\n  I outlined to the President the discussion on the above subject\nbetween the General Staffs and the State Department as it had de-\nveloped in the Committee on Dependent Area Aspects of Interna-\ntional Organizations. I outlined the agreement that had been\nreached on the general category of strategic areas, and told the Presi-\ndent that the military had indicated that they would interpret stra-\ntegic areas as an entire area-for instance, all of the Japanese islands,\nnorth of the Equator, that might come under the administration of\nthe United States. I told him that under their interpretation, the\nentire group of islands irrespective of whether they were fortified\nor not would be exempt from substantially all of the international\nagreements pertaining to civilian populations; that the military had\nbeen unwilling to agree to divide strategic areas into two categories-\nclosed areas and open areas.\n  The President said that he would favor these two categories and\nthat the open areas should be subject to international agreements.5\'\nHe said that if the military wanted, at a later date due to change in\nstrategy, to make all or part of the open area a closed area, it should\nbe provided that this could be done with the approval of the Security\nCouncil.\n  The President then asked me, "What is the Navy\'s attitude in regard\nto territories? Are they trying to grab everything?" I replied that\nthey did not seem to have much confidence in civilian controls. The\nPresident then asked me how I accounted for their attitude.\n  I said that I thought that the military had no confidence in the\nproposed United Nations Organization. The President replied that\nhe thought that was so. I told the President of the letter that Ad-\nmiral Willson showed me addressed to the Secretary of the Navy,\nreferring to the need of sending representatives to San Francisco in\norder to protect themselves against "the international welfare boys".\nThe President then said that neither the Army nor the Navy had any\nbusiness administering the civilian government of territories; that\nthey had no competence to do this.\n6 Parliamentary Debates, House of Commons, 5th series, vol. 407, col. 2092.\n51For a statement on some observations made by President Roosevelt at a\nCabinet meeting of March 9, 1945, about his conception of the trusteeship\nidea,\nsee The Forrestal Diaries, p. 33.\n122\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
