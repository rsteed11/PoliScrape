Hiss read the Soviet Ambassador\'s letter of April 12, 1945 4\nproposing corrections to the minutes of the April 3 meeting. The\ncorrections were accepted by the Secretary and the British and Chi-\nnese Ambassadors.\n  THE SECRETARY suggested that each Ambassador give any report\nhe might be in position to make.\n  THED BlrrISH AMBASSADOR reported that his Government has indi-\ncated assent on all proposals previously referred to it from the In-\nformal Organizing Group with the exception of two: first, the allo-\ncation of Executive Committee positions and officerships of the\nCommissions and Committees and, secondly, the [personal suggestion\nwhich he had made at the last meeting concerning the] 49 Conference\nchairmanship. Lopw HALIFAx indicated that the British Govern-\nment is in general agreement with the proposed allocations but that\nit suggests that no strictly final agreement be undertaken at this time\nbecause of the fact that fuller information regarding delegations and\nrelated questions will probably be available at San Francisco before\nthe Conference convenes.

[With regard to the second point, LoRD HALIFAX said\nthat he had not yet received the comments of his Government on the\npersonal- suggestion which he had made.] 51 [THE SECRETARY said\nthat unless this question is definitely solved the confusion would be\nhopeless.] 50\n  THE SECRETARY then called on THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR who took\nup first the question of languages in which the Conference proceed-\nings should be published. He requested on behalf of his Government\nthat all main documents of the Conference and the official journal\nbe published in five languages, English, French, Spanish, Russian\nand Chinese.
