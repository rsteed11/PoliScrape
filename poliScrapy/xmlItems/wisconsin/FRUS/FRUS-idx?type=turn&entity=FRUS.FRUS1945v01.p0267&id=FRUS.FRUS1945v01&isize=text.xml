General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 205\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nbeen prepared for the President,29 recommending that the four Cab-\ninet Officers30 should present to the President the various aspects\nof the issue concerning conversations on territorial trusteeship. Mr.\nRaynor stated that we wished to make certain that the references to\nthe position taken by the Secretaries of War and Navy were correctly\nstated in the memorandum.\n  After reading the memorandum, Mr. Bundy and Major Correa said\nthat the memorandum, in effect, means that the Secretary of State\nhad changed his position from that agreed to last Monday,3' and\nthat he was now proposing that the conversations should not be\npostponed, and that the present draft plan on trusteeship should be\ntaken as a basis of American policy.\n  Mr. Raynor stated that the Secretary of State had taken the advice\nof a number of officers and had come to the conclusion that, in view of\nthe Yalta agreement to discuss this question,32 he could not recommend\npostponement, and that instead he urged that both the views of the\nWar and Navy Departments and the differing views of the State\nand Interior Departments should be laid before the President for\ndecision.\n  After discussing several minor points to which they objected in\nthe memorandum, it became clear that the disagreement is not over\nthe trusteeship plan but with the discussion at this time of any trustee-\nship structure or arrangement. The view of the Secretaries of War\nand Navy is that it is impossible to discuss trusteeship machinery\nwithout reference to specific territories, and further, that such dis-\ncussion might seriously interfere with the success of the Conference.\n  We replied that there was some risk in this, but that there was\nperhaps a greater risk in not taking up the subject; of trusteeships\nat all, in view of the fact that the public has already been' informed\nthat such discussions would take place and that the Yalta ageeinent\nrequired that the discussions be held. They agreed that the decision\nto hold discussions had been taken at Yalta but still hoped that after\nreconsideration the discussions could either be postponed or confined\nmerely to a resolution at San Francisco that the question be con-\nsidered by the United Nations Organization after its establishment.\n  We agreed that the only fundamental difference between us was\nthe question of postponing the conversations, and that the remaining\n  9 Draft not printed.
