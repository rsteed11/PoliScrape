EDEN stated that the\nU.K. Delegation had a new proposal which he proceeded to read.\nMr. Stettinius thought this a very good proposal and then- when DR.\nSOONG said he preferred the words "equitable geographical distribu-\ntion" both Mr. Eden and Mr. Stettinius approved the change.\n  MR. MOLOTOv thought that contribution towards the maintenance of\npeace and security and geographical distribution should not be put\non the same plane and therefore proposed insertion of the words "and\nalso" between the two clauses and the omission of the symbols (A)\nand (B). When MR. DUNN inquired why the words "in the first\ninstance" were inserted, MR. MOLOTOV explained that it was because\nthe contribution to peace and security should come first. MR. DUNN\nthen said that he thought the U.S. should reserve its position, but MR.\nSTmrNimIus said it was necessary to reach a decision and asked whether\nthe two factors could not be put on the same plane. MR. PASVOISKY\ncommented that some nations are interested in one criterion, some in\nanother, to which ME. EDEN replied that everyone should be inter-\nested in the first criterion. Mr. Stettinius withdrew his objection and\nDr. Soong his reservation, and all agreed to the U.K. Proposal as\nmodified by Dr. Soong\'s and Mr. Molotov\'s amendments.\n               8. RIGHTS OF NON-MEMBER STATES\n  MR. STErINIUS stated that the U.S. withdrew its reservation to the\nproposed Chinese proposal for an addition to paragraph 2 of VIII, A,\nrespecting the requirement that non-member states accept the obliga-\ntions of peaceful settlement provided in the Charter. Mr. Molotov\nalso withdrew his objections and this amendment was therefore\nagreed to.\n9. SECURITY COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS OF TERMS OF SETTLEMENT\n  In introducing the discussion of the U.K. Proposal -for an addition\nto paragraph 4 of VIII, A,87 M. STETrINIUS expressed regret that\nU.S. still could not accept the change. To this MR. EDEN (or another\nU.K. spokesman) commented that this is a very important matter.\n  MR. PASvOLSKY then explained that this introduced a new element\ninto the picture: to give the Council the power to recommend terms\nof settlement on its own alters the scheme laid down in Dumbarton\nOaks, and extends the Council\'s powers very considerably. He\nthought it would lead to great difficulty. MR. EDEN in reply said\nthat what worried him was that the Council would not be able without\nthis amendment to do as much as it should. He thought it ought\nto go just as far as possible in the realm of peaceful settlement.\n  8 See minutes of Four-Power meeting, May 2, 9 p. in., p. 548.\n  87 For text, see minutes of Four-Power meeting, May 4, 12: 15 p. m., p.\n598.\n585\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0647&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0647&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0647&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0647&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0647&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0647&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0647&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0646&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0648&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0646&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0648&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0647&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
