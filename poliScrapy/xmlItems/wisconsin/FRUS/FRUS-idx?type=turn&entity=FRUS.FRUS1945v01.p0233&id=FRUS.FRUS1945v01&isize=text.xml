President To Open Conference\n  THE SECRETARY explained that he had discussed with the President\nthe President's plans with regard to the Conference and that the\nPresident had said that he would do anything that we felt was the\nproper thing to do....\n  It was generally agreed that announcement should be made that\nthe President would open the Conference and that the question of\nhis closing the Conference would be left open.\n2. List of Advisers\n  THE SECRETARY reported that he had talked over with the President\nthe list of advisers for the United States Delegation. A copy of the\nList of Advisers (March 29, 1945 5) was distributed to each\nmember.\n3. Unofficial Observers From National Organizations\n  A classified List of Private National Organizations was then dis-\ntributed to the members.\n  THE SECRETARY said that he had talked over with the President\nthe whole question of representation of national organizations at\nSan Francisco and that, while the President realizd the difficulties\nof the plan previously suggested by the Departmentf he had felt it\nwould do considerable harm if no, recognition was given to the lead-\ning national organizations. The President favored limiting the list\nto about 30 organizations and allowing each of these organizations to\nsend one representative. Of course each organization would pay the\nexpenses of their representative. There would be a liaison office to\nfacilitate communication with these representatives, and they would\nbe free to attend the plenary sessions and the commission meetings,\nbut they would not be listed as advisers.\n4. Assignment of Members of the Delegation to Commissions\n  THE SECRETARY stated that one further matter that he thought should\nbe discussed at this meeting was the tentative assignment of\ndelegates to the several commissions of the Conference.
