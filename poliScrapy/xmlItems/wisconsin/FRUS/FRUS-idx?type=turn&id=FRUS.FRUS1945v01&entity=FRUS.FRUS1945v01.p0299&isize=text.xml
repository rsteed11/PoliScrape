TmH SECRETARY said that he assumed that this pro-\nposal would in substance provide for one regular president and three\nhonorary presidents. After further discussion it was agreed that\nthe Soviet Ambassador would refer the suggestion to his Government,\nthat the Secretary would take it up with the President, and that Lord\nHalifax (who had offered this course as a purely personal suggestion)\nwould refer it to the British Government.\nB. Allocation of Conference Positions\n  The Department's memorandum of April 9 on this subject was\nsubmitted and explained, and it was pointed out that the Department\nfelt that a list giving the allocation of the Conference positions should\nbe submitted to the Steering Committee at its first meeting as the\njoint recommendation of the sponsors. LORD hALIFAx suggested that\nthis matter might be left open until San Francisco when the Secre-\ntaries General of the delegations of the four sponsoring governments\nshould meet and agree on a list. In reply to this suggestion, THE SEC-\nRETARY pointed out that it would be easier to agree on a list in advance\nthan under the pressure certain to exist during the opening days of\nthe Conference. AR. GRoMYKo agreed with the Secretary. LoRD\nHALIFAX said that he would communicate the Secretary's views to his\nGovernment.\nC. Problem of Official Languages\n  LORD HIFAx stated that his Government agreed with the United\nStates' suggestions subject to the proviso that this decision with re-\nspect to the Conference should not prejudice the decision as to the\nofficial language or languages of the international organization. THE\nCHINEsE AMBASSADOR also agreed. MR. GROMYxO stated that he had\nreceived no word from his government on this point.\nD. Unofficial Representation of Certain International Organizations\n  1. The draft communication prepared by- the Department was\nread.87 In reply to THE SECRETARY'S question as to why the Red Cross\nhad been omitted, it was pointed out that that organization is not\nintergovernmental. As to the five organizations in question it was\nstated that the British, Soviet and Chinese Governments had indi-\ncated to the Department that they agreed that these organizations\nshould be invited to send unofficial representatives to the Conference.\nSoviet approval had been given by the Soviet Government to the\nUnited States Embassy in Moscow.88\n  ' See, UNCIO Documents, vol. 1, p. 3, for text of message which was sent\nto\nthe following inter-governmental organizations: League of Nations, Permanent\nCourt of International Justice, International Labor Organization, United\nNa-\ntions Interim Commission on Food and Agriculture, and United Nations Relief\nand Rehabilitation Administration.\n  13 Telegram 999, April 1, 1 p. m., from Moscow Informed the Department\nof\nSoviet approval;
