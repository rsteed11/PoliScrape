General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 517\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked if this created any difficulty under\nthe United States Constitution, which provides specifically for one\nSupreme Court. He wondered if this international court, in being\nmade a court of last resort would not be superior to the United States\nSupreme Court, if anybody cared to appeal a case to the international\ncourt. SENATOR CONNALLY remarked that no individuals would appear\nbefore the international court. MR. HACKWORTH pointed out that the\nworld court was an international court with cognizance over disputes\nbetween states, whereas the Supreme Court was charged with juris-\ndiction over the internal affairs of the United States and did not have\ncompetence to settle disputes between the United States and other\ncountries. He noted that the international court had the same type\nof jurisdiction as arbitral tribunals to which the United States had had\nrecourse on many occasions. SENATOR CONNALLY observed that the\nfields of jurisdiction of the two courts were quite separate. He there-\nfore stated that the order of the Delegation, with respect to the nomina-\ntion of judges, should stand for the present, and that Mr. Hackworth\nwould report back to the Delegation.\n  MR. HACKWORnI then read off the alternative drafts which he had\nprepared for Chapter VII of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals (US\nGen 22).4&#176; MR. HACKWORTH observed that paragraph 6 of the draft\nfor a new court attempted to tie in the treaties referring to the present\ncourt to the new court in so far as possible.41 MR. DULLES asked if this\nprovision took care of the point raised by Commander Stassen to the\neffect that the prior decisions of the Permanent Court of International\nJustice should have the same weight as decisions of the new court.\nSENATOR CONNALLY doubted if it would be wise to make a statutory\ndirection to the court. MR. DULLES said he was merely suggesting that\nthe same weight be given to the decisions of the old court, as would be\ngiven to the decisions of the new court. MR. FAHY thought that the\ncourt should be free to give whatever weight it chose to these pre-\ncedents, without a statutory direction. COMMANDER STASSEN thought\nthat some language would be necessary, perhaps to the effect that the\ncourt "may" give the same weight to the prior precedents. SENATOR\nCONNALLY observed that the decisions of the old court would be pre-\ncedents, and that the court itself would go back to these precedents\nbut should be free to change these precedents if it so desired. CoM-\nMANDER STAS\'SEN said he assumed that the precedents of the old court\nwould be preserved. SENATOR CONNALLY observed that the decisions\nof the Permanent (  . rt of International Justice would be most per-\n40 Draft of April 30 not printed (U.S. Gen. 22).\n41 Draft article 6 read as follows: "When a treaty our other agreement\nin\nforce between parties to the Statute provides for reference of any matter\nto\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice or to an officer of that Court,\nthe\nInternational Court of Justice shall be deemed to be the Court referred to\nin\nsuch treaty or agreement."\n517\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0579&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0579&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0579&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0579&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0579&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0579&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0579&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0578&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0580&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0578&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0580&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0579&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
