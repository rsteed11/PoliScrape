General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 533\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nfor all people. He thought that in this country it had definite mean-\ning and that it should be understood that what was desired was equal\nrights for every citizen of every nation, within that nation. He said\nhe had taken that up with Mr. Pasvolsky earlier. He wondered what\nhuman rights really meant; did it mean equal rights? If not, he\nasked, what did it mean?\n  THE SECRETARY said that Dr. W. W. Cumberland of the National\nAssociation of Manufacturers thought that the language in the Dum-\nbarton Oaks Proposals on the Economic and Social Council was too\nindefinite for the future. There were too many generalities and\nvague hopes. His organization wanted language used in the redraft\nof this chapter that would give assurance that the Council and its\nprogram would really come into being soon. They did not want it left\nmerely that the organization had a right to make the sort of arrange-\nments outlined. THE SECRETARY, himself, thought that Mr. Cumber-\nland had made a strong point.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG commented that the Russians were proposing\nin Chapter I the addition of the clause "and encouragement of respect\nfor human rights and particularly the right to work and the right to\neducation and also for fundamental freedoms for all without distinc-\ntion as to race, language, religion or sex". REPRESENTATEV BLOOM\nsaid that the Russians repeated this proposal several times in their\nsuggested amendments."\' MR. NOTTER added that it appeared three\ntimes.\n  THE SECRETARY asked what could be done about the Human Rights\nCommission which the Consultants group was proposing. MR. PAS-\nVOLSEY observed that the British wanted to drop the enumeration of\ncommissions from Chapter IX and leave the Economic and Social\nCouncil free to set up such commissions as may be required. They\nthought this was not a statutory matter and that it was something\nthat might be left to the organization itself to handle.\n  DEAN GILDERsLEEVE said that a number of people had spoken to her\nabout the importance of making sure that the work of the existing\nLeague of Nations Committees in the field of economic and social co-\noperation should be carried on. She was sure no one would object to\nthat, but the matter needed clarification.\n  THE SECRETARY said he was in favor of informing the President\nthis evening about this matter and telling him of the sincerity with\nwhich the proposals had been put forward. He wished also to report\nthe urging of the Consultants\' group that the United States should\nhack the proposals heartily even though they might fail eventually.\nHle felt that the Delegation should make public its position. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG said he approved of taking a public stand, on this issue;\nhe thought it would make for better public relations all around.
