He\nthought that Mr. Rockefeller\',.might have something to contribulte_ on\nthis point since a great deal of the pressure was emanating from the\nLatin American group. MR. ROCKEFELLER said that this was in part\na reflection of the desire of Brazil for a permanent-seat and of the\ngroup as a whole for at least two nonpermanent seats.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN expressed the opinion that-the delegations\npressing for an increase in membership should be reminded that the\nfive permanent members represented 65 percent of the peoples of the\nworld. SENATOR CONNALTY said in this connection that in the As-\nsembly all states, regardless of size and importance, would have an\nequal vote and that a majority would elect six of the members of the\nSecurity Council. MR. DuLinms characterized the discussion develop-\ning on this subject as "academic" since an increase in the permanent\nand non-permanent members was out of the question. MR. ROCKEFEL-L\nLER held that while this might be true it was desirable and wise to allow\nfull and free discussion since it would permit the middle and small\nstates to "get the thing off their chests".\n      COMMANDER STASSEN\'S PROGRESS REPORT ON TRUSTEESHIP\n  COMMANDER STASSEN reported that the conversations with the other\nfour powers had not yet reached the stage where anything could be ap-\nproved and indicated that the following problems were being\ndiscussed:\n  (a) the non-discriminatory language was opposed by the British\nand the French and the possibility of a different approach was being\nexplored.\n  (b) the British opposed the distinction between strategic and non-\nstrategic territories.\n  (c) the handling of welfare problems of the inhabitants of the\ntrusteeship territories was causing difficulties and it had been sug-\ngested that jurisdiction over these problems be delegated by the Secu-\nrity Council to the trustee governments.\n  (d) we were opposing a British proposal that the trusteeship gov-\nernments have the right to conscript the forces and facilities of the\ntrusteeship territory.\n  (e) the British and French opposed the right to petition and in-\nvestigate. We were standing firm on the right to petition and would\ninsist on some right of inspection within the general trusteeship ter-\nritories.\n  (f) France was opposed to the self-government phrase, apparently\nbecause of the absence of an adequate equivalent in French.
