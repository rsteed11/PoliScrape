If the\nphrase "adequate measures" was used, however, he felt the Secretary\nof the Navy would go along and feel that the document did the trick.\nA question still remained, however, as to the wisdom of adopting\neither the Soviet or the American language at this point and MR. KANE\nsuggested that it might be best to use for opening sentence of para-\ngraph 12 simply "Nothing in this Charter impairs the inherent right\nof self defense, either individual or collective." THE SECRETARY\nasked if General Embick had anything to add to Mr. Kane\'s state-\nment. GENERAL EMBICK replied in the negative, except to say that\nhe had always thought that the normal method by which enforce-\nment action would be taken was by regional arrangements.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG wondered why the addition of the phrase\n"the development of peaceful" did not actually strengthen Section\nC. He thought that when regional facilities were emphasized and\nidentified in this way Chapultepec and the entire regional mecha-\nnism was strengthened. He said he was unable to see how the change\nunder Section C diluted emphasis on regional arrangements, and\nhe thought it was good to emphasize the role of regional arrange-\nments in peaceful settlement. MR. KANE said the question was\nwhether by adding this phrase in the last sentence of Section C. we\nwere placing any limitation on regional arrangements not elsewhere\nexplicitly stated. ADMIRAL HEPBURN pointed out that Mr. Kane had\ncorrectly stated the issue. He thought, however, that it was quite\nclear that Section C, paragraph 1 dealt only with pacific settle-\nment, while paragraph 2 dealt with enforcement. He noted that\nthe four words in dispute were in paragraph 1 and, therefore, had no\ndirect relationship to the role of regional agencies in enforcement.\n  MR. IDULLES expressed the view that the added phrase did not affect\nparagraph 2 or place any further limitations on enforcement actioni\nby regional organizations. ADMIRAL HEPBURN said he tended to agree\nwith Mr-. Dulles that paragraph 12 of Section B was quite explicit on\nthe matter. GENERAL EMBICK felt, however, that the addition of the\nwords in Section C de-emphasized the role of regional arrangements\nin enforcement action.\n  THE SECRETARY called on Mr. Pasvolsky to state the results of the\nconsultations with the Subcommittee of Five on this question. MR.\nPASVOLSKY stated that the policy he had followed in that Committee\nwas to find out exactly what we all wanted to say in paragraph 12 and\nthen to put the matter into a draft. First, however, he said he would\nlike to go back to Dumbarton Oaks to give a bit of explanation. He\npointed out that it had been clear to all who participated at Dumbar-\nton Oaks that regional arrangements would be used for pacific settle-\nment as one of the means of pacific settlement which a state could\n815\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0877&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0877&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0877&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0877&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0877&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0877&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0877&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0876&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0878&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0876&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0878&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0877&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
