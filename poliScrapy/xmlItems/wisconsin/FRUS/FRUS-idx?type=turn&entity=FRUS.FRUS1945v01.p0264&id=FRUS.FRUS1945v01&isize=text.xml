The Soviet Government said it had no objections either to\ngiving the French Government further opportunity to study this ques-\ntion in order to adopt a positive decision prior to the convening of the\nConference, or to our giving an assurance to the French Government\nin this respect.\n  On March 14 the British Govermnent informed US 20 that it is in\nfavor of the step proposed by us. Eden said that a great deal would\ndepend on timing and approach and suggested that Winant speak\nfirst to Massigli, leaving it to Massigli to prepare ground in Paris\nbefore the matter was taken up there. We informed London on\nMarch 19 21 that after carefully considering Eden's suggestion we felt\nthat it would be preferable to have you take the matter up directly with\nBidault 21a since you had been handling this question with the Foreign\nOffice from the beginning. We also said that, if France is to act as\nsponsor, it would be advisable to have her become a party to prepara-\ntions as soon as possible, and that therefore a prompt approach on the\nmatter is considered desirable. On March 21 London informed us 22\nthat our suggested procedure was acceptable to Eden.\n  In the meantime, reports from Paris indicated that the Provisional\nGovernment was preparing to communicate to the sponsoring govern-\nments its comments on the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals with recom-\nmendations for numerous amendments, and these were transmitted\nto this Government officially on March 21.23 These comments and\namendments have since received widespread publicity.\n  From our review and study of the proposed French amendments,\nwe assume that their character-coupled with the publicity given to\nthem-precludes the Provisional Government's becoming a sponsor\nof the San Francisco Conference on the same basis as the other spon-\nsoring governments, i.e., as stated in the invitations, that the Confer-\n   Telegram 390, March 9, 5 p. m., not printed.\n   19Telegram 734, March 13, 7 p. m., not printed.\n   '0 Telegram 2634, March 14, 8 p. m., not printed.\n   2 Telegram 2133, March 19, midnight, not printed.\n   21a Georges Bidault, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government\nocf France.\n  '3 Telegram 2901, March 21, noon, not printed.\n  '3 Despatch 1398, March 21, transmitting the French text of the French\nnote\nof March 21 with accompanying proposed amendments, not printed.
