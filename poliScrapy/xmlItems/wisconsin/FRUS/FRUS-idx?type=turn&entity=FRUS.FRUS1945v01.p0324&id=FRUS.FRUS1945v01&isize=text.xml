TAVT stated that many foreign countries did not think that the\nmatter of employment was a matter solely for domestic concern and\nthat we had received several requests from other countries for the\nholding of a conference on full employment.\n  MIR. EATON remarked that some people had even gone so far as to\nrequest that we should arrange at San Francisco for the maintenance\nof minimum wages, an 8-hour day and a 40-hour week, etc. etc.\n  MR. WHITE stated that he was impressed that the main purpose of\nthe San Francisco Conference would be security. He thought that\nthere would be enough problems involved in that without injecting\nother matters. He wondered whether we could not have more gen-\neral language dealing with the economic and social fields and leave\nit to subsequent conference to spell those objectives out.\n  THE SECRETARY agreed with Mr. White's view. SENATOR VANDEN-\nBERG remarked that if we thrust these objectives into the San Francisco\nConference the result would be the November election all over again.\nHe repeated that he did not oppose these objectives in the abstract but\nthat as a practical matter, so far as the San Francisco Conference was\nconcerned, the faster we could reach agreement on the economic and\nsocial side of the Organization and get it out of the way the better\noff we would be.\n  MR. TAFT pointed out that even though the United States should\nnot propose these objectives it is probable that other countries would\nbring them up. He mentioned that the Latin American countries\nwere particularly interested in these fields and had expressed a defi-\nnite desire for the inclusion of specific proposals. Also, in recent\ndiscussions with the British and Russians regarding an Advisory\nEuropean Economic Committee,23 to deal with pressing wartime prob-\nlems, the Russians had first indicated a willingness to establish such a\nCommittee but had later taken the position that nothing should be\ndone until the San Francisco Conference. We had received the defi-\nnite impression from the Russians that they would make detailed\nproposals at San Francisco with regard to economic and social mat-\nters. In the light of these developments it could be anticipated that\na great deal of pressure would come from other countries for the\ninclusion in the Charter of detailed objectives such as those which had\nbeen recommended by the Executive Committee.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG thought that the arguments presented by\nMr. Taft made it all the more necessary that in so far as these objec-\n  23 For documentation on Anglo-American-Soviet discussions regarding the\nestab-\nlishment of a European Economic Comnmittee, see Foreign Relations, 1944,\nvol.\nII, pp. 614 if.; see also ibid., 1945, vol.
