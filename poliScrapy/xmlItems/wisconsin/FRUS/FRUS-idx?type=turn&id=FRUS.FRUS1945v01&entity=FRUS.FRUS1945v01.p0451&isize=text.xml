He thought we should be able to choose\nthe time when we would reach agreement on this question.\n  Senator Connally said that if we supported the Russian proposal\nand failed to put it over we would be discredited. On the other hand\nif we insisted that the little countries should go along we would con-\ntribute to the already prevalent notion that the big countries were\ndominating the Conference. He wondered whether it would not be\npossible to settle the Russian proposals all at once. He thought that\nif a settlement of the Polish question could be reached it would ease\nthe blow of this other agreement.\n  Representative Bloom asked at what point on the list the United\nStates would vote since, if it led off, the impression would be created\nthat we were trying to dominate, while if we voted later on the list\nthis impression might not be given.

Mr. Rockefeller\nexplained that they wanted Argentina invited to the Conference.\nThey do not want to disrupt the Conference and therefore they would\nnot push their position but they do feel that in view of the position\ntaken in Mexico 98 that it is time to admit Argentina to the United\nNations.\n  The Secretary noted that no word had come from Molotov on the\nrequest of the Argentinian Government to be recognized. The Sec-\nretary then announced that Ambassador Harriman had come to the\nmeeting and that he wished to have him speak on the question under\ndiscussion.\n  Ambassador Harriman said that since the Yalta Conference our\nrelations with Russia had taken a very different turn. The relations\nof war time were now developing into the beginning of the relations\nof peace time, which might in part explain the change in our rela-\ntions.
