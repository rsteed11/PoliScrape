Und 128)\n  MR. BLOOM questioned whether with so many -other treaties coming\nup it was wise to make a statement at this particular moment regard-\ning the negotiation of a treaty to implement the Act of Chapultepec.\nMIR. DULLEs indicated that the problem was that the Latin American\ncountries were not interested in any academic statement but were con-\ncerned to know whether we were going ahead with the negotiation\nof a treaty on a permanent basis. Ma. BLOOM indicated that he had\nno objection to the basic idea but that he questioned the wisdom of\nbringing up at this time a matter still far in the future. MR. DuEwTs\nstated that this statement by the President was relevant now. It was\nthe price we had to pay for omitting reference to the Act of Chapul-\ntepee in the document. MR. ROCKEFELLER thought it might be pos-\nsible simply to announce during the Conference that an Inter-Ameri-\ncan Conference would be held in the fall. THE SECRETARY questioned\nwhether this was the proper time to mention such a Conference. SEN-\nATOR VANDENBERG stated that the truth of the matter was that the\nSouth Americans would not go home without mention of the Act of\nChapultepec in the Charter or a statement that we would implement\nthe Act of Chapultepec. Since we could not specifically mention the\nAct of Chapultepec in the Charter without becoming involved in the\nenumeration of other regional groups, including the Pan Arab League,\nand since this was impossible, the only answer was to go ahead with a\npromise to implement the Act of Chapultepec.\n  MR.- BLOOM questioned why the matter had to be brought up during\nthe Conference. SENATOR VANDENBERG replied that it was necessary\nin order to have the Latin Americans come along. Mu. BOWMAN\nproposed that a statement might be made just at the close of the\nConference.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said he had gotten into the state of mind\nwhen he would like to see us quit rewriting every draft as a result of\nevery little protest, establish our point of view and announce it. TmH\nSECRETARY commented that the position of the Delegation on the prob-\nlem now before it had changed twice since he last saw the papers.\nSENATOR VANDENBERG expressed disapproval at having meetings of\nAdvisers called to revise drafts agreed to by the Delegation. THE\nSECRETARY indicated that he was getting quite discouraged at the diffi-\nculties of reaching agreement on this question.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked whether he could raise a point concerning\nthe amendment to Chapter VIII, Section B, new paragraph 12.
