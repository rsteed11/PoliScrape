The right of self-defense is an\ninherent right and is not restricted to the case of a direct attack. The\nconcept is much broader. He recalled that the concept of an indivis-\nible peace had dominated the thinking of Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Hull,\nPresident Truman, and Secretary Stettinius. This concept is that an\nattack against one state in any part of the world is an act against all.\nThis is the concept of world security, not of regional security.\n  Ma. HACKWORTH said that the Act was mentioned merely by way\n\'of example. The Act is in fact merely a first step toward the ambi-\ntion of the United States to prevent and stop aggression through the\ncreation of a world security system. He did not think that we were\nsetting a precedent by referring to the Act since the precedent was\nalready in Article XXII [XXI] of the League.6a He thought that it\nwould be helpful in securing the support of the Latin American bloc\n*and to the world at large to have an example of the kind of regional\nundertaking that we consider desirable.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG inquired as to the distinction between "at-\ntack" in the first sentence and "armed attack" in the second\nsentence.\nMR. DULLES explained that the distinction was made deliberately in\n,order to cover the Monroe Doctrine which has two parts-the case\n*of an overt attack and that of political efforts from outside the con-\ntinent to overthrow the political institutions of the American Repub-\nlics. Perhaps the word "attack" could be used to cover both con-\ntingencies but the second has specific reference to collective action\nunder the Act of Chapultepec. SENATOR VANDENBERG understood\nfrom this that the first was broad enough to cover a propaganda\nattack.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY inquired if it would not suffice to use the lan-\nguage of Article-XXII [XXI] of the League Covenant. MR. DUNN\nread Article XXII [XXI] and SENATOR CONNALLY recalled that he\nhad drafted similar language which would cover both the Monroe\nDoctrine and regional arrangements and indicated a personal pref-\nerence for such language. MR. DULLES thought that this would open\nup regionalism; that the League Article XXII [XXI] was adequate\nfor its time but not now. The new draft doesn\'t refer to regional\narrangements. It avoids the idea of regionalism in preference for\nthe concept of self-defense.\n  MR. GATES reported that the discussions yesterday in Washington\nwere based on the previous idea developed by the Delegation, that is,\n  6 Reference is apparently to article 21: "Nothing iv this Covenant\nshall be\ndeemed to affect the validity of international engagements, such as treaties\nof\narbitration or regional understandings like the Monroe Doctrine, for securing\nthe\nmaintenance of peace", Foreign Relations, The Paris Peace Conference,\n1919,\nvol. xiii, p. 92.\n667\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0729&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0729&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0729&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0729&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0729&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0729&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0729&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0728&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0730&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0728&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0730&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0729&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
