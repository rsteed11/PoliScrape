The discussion then turned to the operations in Southeast Asia,\nwith particular reference to Operations CAPITAL and DRACULA. As re-\ngards CAPITAL, THaE PRIME MINISTER said that, while he accepted the\nobligation of securing the air route and attaining overland communi-\ncations with China, any tendency to overinsure in this operation\nwould have the effect of ruling out DRACULA, which he and the British\nChiefs of Staff were particularly set on carrying out before the mon-\nsoon of 1945.\n  h. At this point THE PRIME MINISTER read out a note on the pro-\nvision of forces for DRACULA (see Annex I) 7 in amplification of which\nhe made certain suggestions about the timing of the movements of\nforces from the United States. If the United States authorities could\nsee their way to assisting the operations in Burma with one or two\ndivisions it would be better to move two divisions from the later\nschedules of the United States Army transportation to Europe than\nto take two divisions from General Montgomery's Army which was\nnow actually fighting. This would bring additional troops more\nrapidly into action against the Japanese without withdrawing any\nof those already fighting in Germany. He did not ask for a decision\non these proposals there and then but asked if the United States\nChiefs of Staff would examine his suggestion.\n  GENERAL MARSHALL undertook to examine the Prime Minister's pro-\nposals. He said, however, that there was only one light division avail-\nable and this had been reorganized and allocated to the European\nTheater at the special request of General Eisenhower. Every division\nin the United States was already allocated either to General Eisen-\nhower or to the Pacific. The last divisions for the European Theater\nof Operations were scheduled to sail either the last week in January\nor the first week in February. The only way of providing United\nStates divisions for Burma was by taking them from approved allo-\ncations. In this connection he said General Stilwell was desirous of\nhaving an American division assigned him; in fact, he wanted two if\nhe could get them.\n  R. Continuing, GENERAL MARSHALL said that he had recently learned\nof an impression that the increase in the requirements for DRACULA\nhad been brought about by pressure from United States authorities.\nA-fter a thorough inquiry he had found that this impression was\ngroundless. No United States authorities bad advocated any such\nincreease.\n  At the President's request, GENERAL MARSHALL outlined certain\ndevelopments with regard to the Chinese forces.
