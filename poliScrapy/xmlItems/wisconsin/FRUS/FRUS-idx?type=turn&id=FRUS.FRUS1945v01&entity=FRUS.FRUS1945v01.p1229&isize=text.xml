Any subject of such a nature, SECRETARY SlkTIus said, would\nprobably cohe from the Latin American countries. -MT. ROCEFLER\nreplied that he would not discuss Spain and had been hesitant even\nabout mentioning Italy. Mn. NowmTn reported that it had been\nrumored that Russia wanted Mexico to bring up the question of Spain\nthat day or the next. SENATOR CONNALLY asked why this question\nshould be discussed since there was no question of admitting Spain\nto the Conference. MER. ROCKEFELLER said that the intention was to\nexclude the existing government of Spain from becoming a member of\nthe United Nations. THE SECRETARY thought that this matter should\nnot be allowed to come up but MR. DUNN declared that it was possible\nfor any matter to be brought before the Executive Committee. 1VkR.\nDUNN remarked that politically it would be impossible for the United\nStates to oppose any resolution for the purpose of keeping the Franco\nGovernment from participating in the Organization. THE SECRE-\nTARY declared that he had made a very good impromptu speech at a\ntestimonial dinner for Mr. Padilla on the previous day and thought\nthat the latter could reciprocate by not bringing up the Spanish ques-\ntion. MR. RocamsLER thought this was a very "hot" issue but THE\nSECRETARY thought that he would- have to take whatever came and\nhope there would be someone there to back him up. SENATOR VAN-\nDENBERG thought he would change his mind about attending the meet-\ning. MR. ARMSTRONG cautioned against allowing this Delegation to\nbe placed in a position of opposition to a resolution which might be\noffered. Such an action, he thought, could be interpreted as favoring\nthe present Franco Government. MR. DUNN urged that the Secretary\nplay the role of a neutral chairman.\n                          TRUSMESHIP\n  COMMANDER STASSEN referred the Delegation to the document,\nTrusteeship, United States Exploratory Draft (US Gen 226) 21 which\npresented some of the questions which were still open before\nCommittee 1I/4.\n  Commander Stassen referred to the wording of paragraph B 2 (b),\nstating the objectives of the trusteeship system as follows:\n  "to promote the political, economic, social and educational advance-\nment of the trust territories and their inhabitants, and their progres-\nsive development toward self government or independence as may be\nappropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its\npeoples (and to the (freely expressed) wishes of the people concerned,\nand as may be provided by the trusteeship arrangement) ".\n  \'1Not printod.\n1167\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
