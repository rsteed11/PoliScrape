Mr. Notter commented that two of the non-permanent\nmembers of the Council would have to, agree.\n  Mr. Dulles stated that he thought that the provisions of VIII, B 1\n[It should take any measures necessary for the maintenance of inter-\nnational peace and security in accordance with the purposes and prin-\nciples of the Organization.] referred to policing measures, such as\neconomic sanctions and military enforcement. He did not think it\nwas intended to decide such matters as revision of immigration or\ntariff policies or territorial revisions. Mr. Bloom asked if domestic\nquestions could be subjected to the action of the Security Council.\nMr. Dulles replied that the exemption of domestic affairs from the\njurisdiction of the Organization applied only to the measures out-\nlined in Section A of Chapter VIII. Mr. Pasvolsky observed that\nthe Security Council could do anything and take any steps if peace\nand security were affected. Representative Bloom said that un-\ndoubtedly the immigration policy of the United States had been con-\nsidered by Japan a threat to peace, and Mr. Pasvolsky answered that\nJapan had never given any indication of wanting to go to war over it.\nRepresentative Bloom said that in his opinion this provision went very\nfar.\n  Mr. Sandifer said that this provision applied to an actual threat to\nor breach of the peace. If domestic affairs were excluded in such a\nsituation, it would be difficult for the Organization to preserve peace\nunder all circumstances. Certainly if there was an actual threat to\nthe peace, the Organization must deal with it. Wr. Notter remarked\nthat this provision would not come into operation until the parties\nhad failed to settle a dispute by means of their own chooqing and\nuntil the Security Council had failed to get them to settle their dis-\npute peacefully. Finally, the Security Council might determine in\nsuch a case that the continuance of the dispute was a threat to the peace\nand that, if peace was to be maintained, the Council must have the\npower to deal with the dispute. Representative Bloom said that only\nCongress can regulate domestic matters.\n  Senator Connally sid that, while it was true that the United States\nhad a veto power in the Security Council, it seemed to him to be putting\ntoo much power and responsibility in the hands of one man to decide\nwhen that veto shoi4d be exercised. Mr. Dulles commouted that if we\nshould have as President or as delegate to the Security Council some-\none who believed that the immigration or tariff policies of the United\nStates should be changed, then by not exer ping the veto he could\nenable the international organization to fore, the United States to\nchange them. Mr. Stassen said that this pointed up another problen,\nand he thought it most important: that when Congress decides about\nthe position of the delegate to the Security Council, it must restrict\nhis powers very carefully.
