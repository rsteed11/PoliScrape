General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 409\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nthe Steering Committee of the Conference, in which event he felt sure\nthat the United States would win its point. In that event, there was\na good likelihood that Molotov might refuse to serve as a vice-chair-\nman of the Conference, although there was no doubt in his mind that\nEden and Soong would accept vice-chairmanships.\n  Mr. Hackworth pointed out that this same question had been in-\nvolved in selecting the chairman of the Committee of Jurists at the\nmeeting in Washington.23\n  Commander Stassen observed that the Soviet proposal for four\nchairmen of equal rank was really an application of the veto principle\nof the voting procedure in the Security Council.\n  In response to a request from the Secretary, Mr. Pasvolsky stated\nthat it was his view that the United States should maintain its position\nthat there should be only one President of the Conference, with three\nVice-Presidents.\n  Representative Eaton also made it clear that it was his view that\nthe Delegation should not accede to the Soviet position.\n  The Secretary then inquired of Messrs. Rockefeller and Dunn as to\nwhether the other countries at the Conference would support the\nUnited States position. Mr. Rockefeller said that the Latin Ameri-\ncan representatives thought that the Soviet proposal for four chair-\nmen was absurd; that in Inter-American conferences the chairman of\nthe delegation of the host country always had the honor of being the\npermanent chairman of the conference; and that the Chilean repre-\nsentatives had specifically told Mr. Molotov that the Soviet proposal\nwas absurd. Mr. Dunn stated that he could not answer positively\nwhat would be the attitude of the countries other than the Latin Amer-\nican ones, but that, in his opinion, most of them would feel that the\nissue was not important enough to incur the displeasure of the Soviet\nUnion by voting against the Soviet proposal.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky then proposed that the United States could con-\nceivably take a new position-different from both the British and\nthe Soviet proposals-along the following lines: The Conference\nwould have four chairmen for plenary sessions who would serve in\nrotation but that there would be no President of the Conference as\nsuch. Instead, the Secretary would serve as chairman of the Steering\nand Executive Committees of the Conference and would be responsible\nfor the executive management of the Conference as a whole. Mr.\nDulles said that, in his opinion, such a proposal if advanced by the\nUnited States, would be a blow to our prestige.\n  23 For documentation on the United Nations Committee of Jurists meeting\nin\nWashlngton from April 9 to April 20, 1945, see The International Court of\nJiastice;\nalso, UNCIO Documents, vol. 14.
