CONFERENCE PROCEDURE ON SURRENDER OF GERMANY 25\n               2. CONSULTATON ON AMENDMENTS\n  MR. STETTINIUS recalled that the consultations of the four Ministers\nup to this time had included only those powers which were represented\nat the Dumbarton Oaks Conversations and concerned only their pro-\nposed amendments to the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. With Mr.\nBidault, joining the group, he felt that they should now turn their\nattention to the amendments proposed by other countries and con-\nsider and review them. MR. BIDAULT said that he agreed with the\nprocedure proposed by Mr. Stettinius but that he wished to call atten-\ntion to the fact that the French Delegation has not yet had the time\nto study completely the amendments proposed by the four powers\nin their own right.\n  MR. STETiNIUS replied that so far as the French Delegation is con-\ncerned, it was understood, of course, that it would be a free agent with\nrespect to the amendments proposed by the four powers to the Dumbar-\n'ton Oaks Proposals; that the French Delegation would not be bound\nby the previous decisions in this regard.\n  MR. STETINIUS said that in order to expedite the work of the five\nForeign Ministers he suggested that a Committee of their deputies\nbe appointed to consider the amendments that are proposed by the\nother nations represented at the Conference. All of the Foreign\nMinisters agreed and accordingly the following appointments were\nmade:\n  MR. SmrINrus appoint[ed] Mr. Leo Pasvolsky to represent the\nUnited States;\n  MR. MoLoTrov appointed Mr. A. A. Sobolev to represent the Union\nof Soviet Socialist Republics;\n  DR. Koo appointed himself as a deputy for the Chinese Delegation,\nin as much as he explained that Mr. Soong had intended that he,\nDr. Koo, bear this responsibility, and that in the interim, Mr. Liang\nwould represent him as an alternate;\n  MR. BIDAULT appointed Mr. Jacques Fouques Duparc;\n  MR. ALEE appointed Mr. Gladwyn Jebb.\n  MR. STEUJINIUS suggested that this Committee of Deputies should\nmeet rather soon .2 and should report back 'to the 'Foreign Ministers\ngroup on Wednesday, May 9, at 3: 00 p. m., at'its next meeting. This\nwas agreed to.\n  DR. Koo suggested that as a method of procedure for ,expediting\nthe work of the Conference, the review by the five Foreign Ministers\n   See Doc. 128, May 8, UNCIO Documents, vol. 2, p. 45.\n   26 The Deputies of the Heads of Delegations of the Five Powers held 36\nmeet-\nings from May 8 to June 15; minutes of meetings not printed.\n629\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0691&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0691&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0691&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0691&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0691&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0691&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0691&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0690&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0692&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0690&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0692&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0691&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
