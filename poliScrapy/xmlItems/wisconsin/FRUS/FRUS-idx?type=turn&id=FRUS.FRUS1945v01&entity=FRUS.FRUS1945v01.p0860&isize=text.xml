DEAN GILERSLEEVE added that,\nif she were sure that the inclusion of this reference would not imperil\nthe final ratification of the Charter, she would favor it. THE SECRE-\nTARY wondered whether it would be possible to include the word "ed-\nucation" in connection with the reference for encouraging education\nin each country. He thought there must be some wording whereby\nwe could get around the objection to that word. SENATOR VANDENBERG\nsaid he had two objections to the use of the word "education":\nIn\nthe first place, it would be a damaging symbol that would be picked\nup in the Senate debate. Secondly, he was not at all impressed by\nhearing that millions of people were in favor of the inclusion of "ed-\nucation" in the Charter. He had heard that kind of argument before.\nHe pointed out, however, that the use of the word was. less important\nthan the way it was used. THE SECRETARY thought that, if the word\nwas mentioned in the right place and in the right way, it would not\ncause embarrassment. He indicated that he would like to include\nthe word if possible.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY pointed out that one difficulty was that educa-\ntion had never been a federal matter. If provision was made in the\nCharter to "promote education" we would be confronted in the Senate\nwith the argument that we were making education an international\nmatter. He did not believe, however, if it was properly stated, that\nreference to education would prevent the ratification of the Charter.\n  THE SECRETARY suggested that the question be analyzed and that,\nif agreeable, Dr. Bowman, in cooperation with Dean Gildersleeve and\nsuch members of the staff as he wished to call upon, should prepare\na draft statement. DEAN GILDERStEEvE indicated that the present\nsituation was that paragraph 1 had been adopted without the word\n"education" in it. MR. BOWMAN thought that we should not dodge\nthe issue presented by the consultants. He thought we had a good\nexample of what we had in mind in the Office of Education which\ndid a very useful job collecting statistics on educational matters.\nDEAN GILDERSLEEVE indicated that that is what they had in mind for\nthe international organization-the .xcha.nge of information and help\non matters of education when requested.
