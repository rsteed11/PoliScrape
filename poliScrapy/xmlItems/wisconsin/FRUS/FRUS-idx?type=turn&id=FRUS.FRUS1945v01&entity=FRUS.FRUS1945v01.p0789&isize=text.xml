EATON noted that Committee 1, Commission II 15 had adopted\nthe following draft texts on membership:\n  "Members of the Organization are the signatories of the Char-\nter whose ratification has become effective in accordance with\nChapter XI."\n  "Membership of the Organization is open to all peace-loving states\nwhich in the judgment of the Organization are able and ready to\naccept and carry out the obligations contained in the Charter."\n  MR. EATON pointed out that the problem was now up in the Sub-\ncommittee of II/1 whether there should be a withdrawal provision.\nHe noted that it was the unanimous opinion of the members of the\nSubcommittee that members of the Organization should not have the\nright to withdraw.

EATON replied that our\nposition was still reserved on this question.\n  THa SECRETARY asked Mr. Sandifer whether we had not already\nmade a decision in the Delegation on this question. MR. SANDIFER\nreplied that we had not reached a final decision but had agreed that\nwe would consider our position on the matter of withdrawal in con-\nnection with any proposal for withdrawal made at the Conference.\nHe added that while no proposal for withdrawal had been made\nUruguay had proposed an amendment under which no members of\nthe Organization would be permitted to withdraw."\' ME.

SENATOR VANDENBERG said he wanted a provision for\nwithdrawal. It was agreed that further discussion of this matter\nwould take place at the evening meeting.\n   NEW ZEALAND AND CANADIAN AMENDMENTS OF ENFORCEMENT\n                          PROCEDURES\n  MR.
