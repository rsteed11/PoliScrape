General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 805\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE inquired how the matter was to be handled\n,and MR. PASVOLSKY explained that the first action was taken in the\nCommittee and then went to the Coordination Committee. MR.\nSTASSEN, returning to the phrase "full employment", expressed the\nview that it would prejudice passage in the Senate. MR. PASVOLSKY\njoined in this, saying that the retention of the phrase would get us\ninto trouble and that the Secretary of Labor did not favor the use\nof the phrase. MR. STINEBOWER explained how the phrase had been\nput, into the report of the Committee by almost unanimous action.\nMR. WARING favored Mr. Stinebower\'s suggestion that subparagraph\n(a) be inserted in the Preamble. MR. DULLES agreed with this. THE\nSECRETARY suggested that the matter be referred back to the Com-\nmittee and DEAN GDERSLEEVE thought it should go back to the\nDrafting Committee. MR. BOWMAN wished to be certain that the\nphrase with respect to educational cooperation should not be lost, and\nDEAN GILDERSLEvE assured him that it would not.\n  MR. STINEBOWER suggested that any further negotiations on "full\nemployment" would have to take place at a, high level. MR. STASSEN\nsaid that getting final approval of- the Charter was the important\nthing. MR. ROCKEFELLER suggested that the basic issue was one of\nideologies. SENATOR VANDENBERG said that when one subscribes to\nfull employment, it may be full employment at low levels and at low\nwages and that its insertion anywhere was bad. SENATOR CONNALLY\nobjected to the phrase "full employment" and didn\'t see any difference\nbetween this and high and stable levels of employment. He would\nrather not have either. MR. DUNN said that it could not be included.\nMR. PAsvOLSEiY informed the Delegates that in the Subcommittee of\nFive meeting the British were opposed to full employment, the\nChinese were in favor of it, and the French were indifferent. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG indicated that he preferred the formula "high and stable\nlevels of employment" and that the idea of full employment could\nnot be sold to the American people. THE SECRETARY suggested that\nthe matter be referred back to the Drafting Committee. SENATOR\nCONNALLY stated that he was opposed to overloading the Charter\nwith all these economic and social matters which were unattainable\ndream stuff. SENATOR VANDENBERG concurred.\n  It was finally decided that the use of the word "promote" was\nacceptable if subparagraph (a) was moved to the Preamble, and\nthat the phrase "full employment" should be opposed in any part\nof\nthe paragraph.\n  Items 2, 3, 4 and 5 were approved with little discussion.\n  On Item 6 relating to the provision on the Council of members of\nmajor economic importance, DR. PASVOLsKY reported that the Sub-\ncommittee of Five was opposed to all amendments but would accept\nfreedom of action on this particular suggestion.
