MR. PASVOLSKY; declared that the instructions of the\nDelegation\' were not clear. He\' was --of the -opinion that the Delega-\ntion was in favor of deleting the word "enforcement". MR. PAS-\nvoLSKY\'declared- that the French were in favor of using the word\n"request" instead of "consent"\'; they\' wanted to\' go\nhome and\nsay that they had proposed a change in the wording of this Chapter\nwhich had \'been \'accepted. TInD SECRETARY asked Mr. Pasvolsky\nwhat his opinion was and the lattef indicated that he would accept it.\nMR. DuNN also supported the change. DR. BOWMAN asked what\nsupport the French had.\' MR. PASVOLSKY- declared that the British,\nwho -had been the authors of the origin\'al phraseology, had indicated\na willingness to accept a new terminology as being superior. MR.\nARMSTRONG declared that he favored "by consent", as originally\n\'agreed upon, and MR. DULLES agreed, declaring that it would be\ndangerous for the Big Four to open up possibility of further change\nin this provision. He said he would favor the change if it was cer-\ntain that this would be the last one proposed, but MR. DULLES was\nfearful that if reopening of the clause were permitted, Russia might\ntry to weasel out". The Russians were of the opinion that the\nUnited States had the advantage of this situation, in view of the\nregional set-up, and MR. DUJLLES was in agreement with the Russian\nposition\' on that point. This pointed to the possibility that the\nRussians might be using the French as an opening wedge to reopen\nthe whole paragraph.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked whether it would be possible to use\nboth words "consent" and "request". MR. DtrLLES declared\nthat the\nmain question at issue was whether or not the paragraph should be\nreopened and REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM agreed to his contention. MR.\nPASVOLSxY remarked, however, that the only suggestion received from\nthe USSR was to drop the whole clause. SECRETARY STETTINIUS\nremarked that this would seem to indicate that it would be a mistake\nto reopen the question. Mi. PASVOLSKY declared that the French\nwere of the opinion that they could return with the wording "by\nrequest", and he went on to say that the French had behaved admir-\nably throughout the Conference. SECRETARY STETTINIUS was of the\nopinion that the United States had been better to them than they\nhad been to us\' and MR. DUNN remarked that the Secretary had been\nbetter to the French than he had expected. COMMANDER STASSEN\ndeclared that the Delegation ought to\'stand by the Four Power agree-\nment. To open up the paragraph would be unfortunate, he thought.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked whether the Delegation was willing\nto agree even to this one chatge. \'He thought it was a question of\n\'9()9\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0971&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0971&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0971&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0971&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0971&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0971&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0971&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0970&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0972&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0970&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0972&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0971&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
