General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 331\n\n\nUNITMD NATIONS CONFERENCE\nwould be coming in late. He further announced that the committee\nwhich met yesterday afternoon to draw up a revised draft statement\non recommended policy on trusteeship had presented a statement, and\nthat it was his understanding that Secretary of War Stimson has\nfound the draft statement satisfactory. [This statement was then\ndistributed to the delegates.] 83\n  MR. STmrINirus read the statement, and MR. GATEStated that the\nstatement was satisfactory to Secretary Forrestal.\n  MR. BUNDY observed that he had shown the statement to Secretary\nStimson last night, and that he had found it generally satisfactory.\nHe had, however, pointed to certain redundancies and suggested that\nthe word "namely" ought to be added after "thereundor"h\nin the ninth\nline. MR. BUNDY stated further that it was his understanding that the\nState Department might raise a question about the phrase "trustee-\nship arrangements" in the eighth line, and that it was agreeable to\nhim if it should be decided to remove this phrase.\n  ADMIRAL WnTsoN questioned the use of the word "shall" in the\nfifteenth line, but MR. BUNDY stated that the Secretary of War pre-\nfers the word "shall" in a policy statement.\n  MR. DuLLn stated that it was the committee\'s idea that this state-\nment would be a directive primarily for the instruction of the Amer-\nican Delegation and that if it were to be used as a statemeht for publi-\ncation it might need some changes. This would be particularly true\nin view of the fact, that there is somewhat too much emphasis on\nUnited States interests and on the Pacific for a public statement.\n  MR. TAuSSIG suggested that in any statement for publication, para-\ngraph 1, which is a negative statement, should be put last.\n  MR. PASvOLSEY suggested the addition of the word "political"\nafter\n"social and economic" in the next to the last line. He pointed\nout that\nin all of the drafts the wording had been "social, economic and\npolitical".\n  MR. SETTNIUS stated that the draft statement has been recom-\nmended by the Army, Navy, and by our political and economic ad-\nvisers and asked if there were any more questions.\n  MR. BLOOM raised a question about the meaning of\'the phrase in\nthe second paragraph dealing with the territories to be put under\ntrusteeship by "subsequent agreement" and wished to know if this\nmeant that all territories in the above categories would be placed under\nthe system.\n  MR. BOWMAN explained that the wording of the statement left\nopen the question as to which specific territories might be placed\nunder the system by "subsequent agreement".\n  \' Brackets appear in the original.
