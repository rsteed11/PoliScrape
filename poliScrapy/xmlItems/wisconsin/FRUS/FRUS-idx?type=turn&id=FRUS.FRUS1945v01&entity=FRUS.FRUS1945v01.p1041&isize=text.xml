General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 979\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n  THEEE SECRHARY asked whether there was much pressure in the\nCommittee supporting the French proposal, and TiH COMMANDER re-\nplied that there seemed to be a great deal of support for the amend-\nment and that there had been a great deal of oratory. THE SEcim-\nTARY asked whether the Commander had any recomnmendation to offer\nto the Delegation and the latter suggested that the United States stand\nby the position he had taken that the whole Atlantic Charter should be\nreferred to rather than any specific part of that document. DR.\nBOWMAN remarked that the importance of following the exact language\nof the Atlantic Charter lay in the context within which it was in-\ncluded. DIR. BOWMAN pointed to the sixth point of the Atlantic Char-\nter which read: "After the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny . .\n.\nThis, he said, eliminated the possibility of granting equal access to\nthe enemy nations at the present time since the Nazi tyranny had not\nbeen completely destroyed.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY observed that question (b) referred to in US Gen\n198, the inclusion in the Charter of "equality of access to raw mate-\nrials, trade and capital goods" would undoubtedly cause a great deal\nof difficulty in Congress. MR. STINEBOWER provided some further\nbackground information for the Delegation. He declared that at\nMexico City two explicit references had been made to freedom of\naccess to raw materials and capital goods.79  He thought that the\nLatin-American countries would not support a United States position\nopposing the principle of equal access although they would probably\nvote with this Government against a specific Organization within the\nstructure of the United Nations Organization. MR. STINEBOWER\nthought that there was an inconsistency in the French amendment\nwith the traditional policy of the United States. If there was to be\nincluded reference and principle to equality of access, there should\nalso be established, he thought, freedom of foreign trade. Mu. Roc}E-\nFELLER cautioned that the analogy drawn between Mexico City and\nthe present Charter was not completely valid because of the fact\nthat the Mexico City Act merely set up objectives. MR. STINEBOWER\ndeclared he was in agreement with the position taken by Commander\nStassen but he urged that it would be impossible to stand on the whole\nAtlantic Charter because of the commitments made at Mexico City.\nTHE SECRETARY asked whether any mention was made of the methodi\nof financing with respect to equality of access to capital goods.\n79 See Final Act of the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War ahl\nPeace, in Report of the Delegation of the United States of America to the\nInter-\nAmerican Conference on Problems of War and Peace, Mexico City, Memicoi,\nFebruary 21-March 8, 1945 (Department of State publication No. -2497), pp.\n118\nand 122; also, 60 Stat.
