Roosevelt, M1orgenthau\nrecalled, sat by, saying very little. See Henry Morgenthau, Jr., "Our\nPolicy Toward Germany: Morgenthau\'s Inside Story", New York\nPost, November 28, 1947, p. 18.\n  The most detailed description of the dinner conversation which has\nbeen found was written by Harry Dexter White, who accompanied\nMforgeuthau to Quebec. No source on the meeting (including White\'s\nmemorandum itself) states that White was present, and it seems prob-\nable that White was summarizing what Morgenthau had told him, or\ntold others in his presence, in the period between September 13 and the\ndate on which White\'s memorandum was prepared. Following is the\ntext of the memorandum, which bears the date "9/25/44" at the end\n(presumably the date of typing):\n  "Thouch shipping was supposed to have been the subject for dis-\ncussion the subject of shipping was not mentioned the entire evening\nexcept briefly when the question was raised as to the advisability of\ntaking away all of Germany s shipping.\n  \'Mhq discussion uickly turned to Germany. Churchill (apparently\nwithout reference to anything said previously) said something along-\nthle line of \'What are mv Cabinet members doing discussing plans for\nGermany without first discussing them with me? I intend to get into\nthe matter myself.\'\n  "The President said he had asked Secretary Morgenthau to come\ntip for the purpose of discussing Germany and that he (Morgen-\ntlhan) was to talk to Cherwell the following day.\n  "Churchill asked: \'Why don\'t we discuss Germaiiy now?\' The\nPresident then asked the Secretary to explain the program lie had in\nmuid for Germany. The Secretary described that part of the Treasury\nprol\')osal dealing with the Ruhr,4 Churchill indicated that he was\nstrongly opposed to such a program. HIe said that all that was neces-\nsary was to eliminate the production of armament. To do what the\nTreasury suggested was \'unnatural, unchristian and unnecessary.\'\nCurohfll:   didn\'t believe that it would be very much of an aid to the\nUnited Kingdom even if the United Kingdom did get the steel busi-\nness t~hat formerly went to Germany.\n  "Adminral Land, on the other hand, wholly supported Secretary\nAMorgenthau\'s proposal, thumping vigorously on the table to emphasize\nhis r niark. Admiral Land told the Secretary after the dinner that\nthe President had been talking with him more or less along those lines\nfor a long time but this was the first time that he (Admiral Land)\nhad a chance to say what he felt. He had long been waiting for the\nopportunitu^y and, encouraged by the Secretary\'s statement, he had\nvigorously expressed himself.\n  "When the question arose about taking away German ships,\nChurchill was opposed. Admiral Land said, \'Why not? It is no more\ncruel to take away ships than their steel plants.\'\n  \'Churchill said at one point: \'If you [the United States] 5 do not\ndo something for Britain then the British simply will have to destroy\n  2ee ante, pp. 129, 135.\n  5Brackets appear in the source text.\n326\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0385&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0385&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
