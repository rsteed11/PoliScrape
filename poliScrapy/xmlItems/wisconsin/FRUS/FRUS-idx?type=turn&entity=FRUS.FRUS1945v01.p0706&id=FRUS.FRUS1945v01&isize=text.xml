DtVLLES stated that he had had some doubt as to whether the\nSoviets really wanted a world organization. Since he had come to\nSan Francisco he had concluded that they would want an organization\nin order to get the maximum possible voice outside their own sphere\nof influence. They accepted the fact that they would be able to deal\nin their own sphere and he believed they felt that, working through\na world security system, they might be able to influence areas outside\ntheir direct control. He thought this might mean that we could get an\nexemption for the Western Hemisphere without actually being driven\nout of Europe. The Russians, wanting to get as much as they could\nin the way of influence outside their own sphere, might be willing to\naccept the best they could get. Mr. Dulles indicated that he was not\nsure that we would have to give up our voice in Western Europe, but\nthat the Secretary might want to keep these ideas in mind in deter-\nmining his tactics.

This will have the effect of making\na party to a dispute unable to vote on decisions as to aggression or\nbreach of peace.\n  " (c) Latin American Republics propose adjustment in regional ar-\nrangements to take care of Act of Chapultepec as was done in the case\nof European treaties.42  (If questioned as to formula, we should say\nthat we have not had time to analyze the question but we are basically\nsympathetic.)"\n  THE SECRETARY thought that an introduction would be necessary\nrunning as follows: He would say that he was terribly sorry that Mr.\nMolotov was leaving, that this was the last time that the ministers\nof the five powers would all meet together. However, he would be\n"With reference to a meeting with Latin American Foreign Ministers,\nMay 8,\n9 a. m., in the Penthouse, Mr. Stettinius reported to the President and Mr.\nHull\nin telegram 2, May 9, as follows: "The chiefs of eight Latin American\ndele-\ngations called on me this morning and presented_,a very urgent plea that\nthe\nimplementation of the Act of Chapultepec not be made subject to the veto\nof a single non-American power. SOn the other hand members \'of the United\nStates delegation pointed out to them the disadvantages which would ensue\nif\nthe focus of international security were to be placed in regional understandings\nrather than in the General International Organization. No conclusion was\nreached and the American delegation is still working actively on the question\nin\nthe hope of finding a satisfactory formula which will relieve the Latin American\napprehensions without seriously weakening the Charter."
