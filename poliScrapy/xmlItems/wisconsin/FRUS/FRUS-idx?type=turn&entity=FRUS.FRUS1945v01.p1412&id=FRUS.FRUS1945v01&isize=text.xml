Loin\nHALIFAX proposed that this be changed to read: "sphere of action of\nthe United Nations, as delimited by the Charter";\n  M. BoNCOiR observed that it was necessary to consider the points of\nview of both parties and recalled that Dr. Evatt had insisted on this\nphrase because a similar phrase was contained in the Covenant of\nthe League of Nations. He agreed, however, that this particular\nphrase \'is too vague, and that the fears of the Soviet Delegation are\njustified. He thought the word "Organization" should be used in-\nstead of "United Nations". MR. DuLLES commented that the phrase\n"United Nations" was used here as the name of the Organization.\nM.\nBoNcoUR \'tthought it was better to state specifically "Organization".\nMR. S&amp;MrINrus also thought that Dr. Evatt was referring to the Or-\nganization in using "United Nations". He asked for Dr. Koo\'s\nreaction.\n  DR. Koo stated that if M. Boncour\'s proposal were acceptable to the\nothers, it was acceptable to him. He then observed that a vast range of\nmatters came within the scope- of the, Charter and he wondered if there\nwere any objection to discussion by the General Assembly of any mat-\nter within the Charter. He did not object to. a specific reference to\n"maintenance of international peace and security".\n  AMBASSADOR GROMYKO thought that it could be stated that the Gen-\neral Assembly should have the right to discuss any matters relating to\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, or to social,\neconomic, educational, and cultural cooperation among nations and\nother questions affecting the maintenance of peace and security. He\nthought this would be a broad formula, but it would be exact and\nwould be in accord with the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. This for-\nmula would not permit the General Assembly to raise any question at\nall, which might in some cases not be in accord with the prindiple of\nsovereignty of states. He asked why we should not use the formula\nof the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals which we had agreed upon.\n  DR. Koo said that it seemed to him that we were very close on what\nthe Ambassador had just said. MR. STETIrNrus said he felt so. DR.\nKoo inquired whether we could not say "discussion of any matter re-\nlating to the maintenance of international peace and security or other-\nwise within the scope of the Charter". This, he thought, would make\nit clear that matters relating to the maintenance of peace and security\nwould not be the only matters that the General Assembly could discuss.\nAMBASSADOR GROMYKO suggested that we might say "any matter within\nthe scope of the Charter affecting the maintenance of international\npeace and security".\n  MR. BONCOUR observed that from the logical point of view, the So-\nviet Delegate was right.
