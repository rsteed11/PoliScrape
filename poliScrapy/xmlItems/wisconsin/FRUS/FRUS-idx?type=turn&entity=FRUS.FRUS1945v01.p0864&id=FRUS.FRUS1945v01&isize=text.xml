In response to\nMi. HICKERSON\'S observation that the South Africans took this amend-\nment very seriously, SENATOR VANDENBERG said he had assumed that\nit was generally understood that all costs were to be charged to us.\n  It was agreed that the interim arrangements now provided for in\nChapter XII should be retained in the Charter, and that the Mexican\nproposal for placing them in a separate protocol should be opposed.\n  It was readily agreed that France should be included along with\nthe signatories of the Moscow Declaration in paragraph 1 of Chap-\nter XII. It was decided that the LUnited States should raise the ques-\ntion in the Committee of Five in order that the way in which the four\nsponsoring powers would support the proposal in Committee III/3\nmight be determined.\n  The Venezuelan proposal for an interim agreement on the supply\nof forces was viewed as impracticable, and it was agreed to oppose\nany amendment to this-effect.\n     PROPOSAL ON REFERENCE TO "EDUCATION" IN THE CHARTER\n  On behalf of the subcommittee on education appointed at the morn-\ning meeting, DR. BOWMAN presented to the Delegation a proposal\n(U.S. Gen. 137 23) by virtue of which he thought it might be possible\nfor the Delegation to approve a specific reference to education in the\nCharter. The proposal was agreed to by the Delegation. The follow-\ning change in IX, A, 1 of the draft already adopted in Committee\n11/3 24 is involved:\n  1. With a view to the creation of conditions of stability and well-\nbeing which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among\nnations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-\ndetermination of peoples, the Organization shall promote:\n      a. higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions\n    of economic and social progress and development;\n      b. solutions of international economic, social, e4lt1r4 health,\n    and related problems s*4\n      c. cultural and educational cooperation, and\n      d. universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and\n    4eX fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race,\n    language, religion, or sex. [Committee II/3 substitute] 25\n  DR. BOWMAN pointed out that the advantage of this redraft was that\n"cultural-problems" were not subject to "solutions"\'\nby the Organiza-\ntion, btut that merely "cooperation" in this field was to be "promoted".\n  23 Not printed.\n  24 Doc. 381, II/3/16, May 17.
