He pointed out that the concept on which we\nhad been operating was that the Court would be integrated with the\nOrganization. Consequently, the members of the Permanent Court\nof International Justice who were not members of the United Nations\nshould be sloughed off. He pointed out that under the Statute, as\nat present drafted, non-members could use the new Court but that\nthey could not take part in the election of judges.\n  MR. HACKWORTH reiterated his question as to whether we should\ncontinue the old Court or establish a new one. SENATOR VANDENBERG\nsaid he thought that it had been agreed to build on the old Court but\nconfine its membership to members of the new Organization. THE\nSECRETARY then stated that there appeared to be agreement for a\nrevised Court based on the Statute of the old Court but that member-\nship of the new Court would be integrated with the new Organization.\n                        OTHER MATTERS\n  MR. JOHNSON referred to the Canadian proposal 57 that the Assem-\nbly should be empowered to define the criteria for the election of\nnon-permanent members to the Security Council. It was agreed that\nany provision in the Charter on this subject should be permissive\nrather than mandatory.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN reported that the Committee on Trusteeship\nhad accepted the Delegation's working paper as a basis for its dis-\ncussion.58 REPPESENTATIVE BLooM inquired when we would be over\nthe hurdle on the question of trusteeship. COMMANDER STASSEN re-\nplied that we should be through the discussions with the Big Five\nin another two days. REPRESENTATivE BLOOM     and COMMANDER\nSTASSEN both expressed the view that a background press conference\nwould- be useful. MR. PASVOLSKY asked whether the working paper\nhad been approved.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN replied that the working paper 59 which was\nin line with the proposals of the United States on trusteeship had been\napproved and that the Army-Navy Group had agreed to it.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG stated that he needed to be advised on what\nto say on regionalism at the meeting of the Subcommittee of Com-\nmittee III/4 which was meeting at 5: 30 p. m.60 MR.
