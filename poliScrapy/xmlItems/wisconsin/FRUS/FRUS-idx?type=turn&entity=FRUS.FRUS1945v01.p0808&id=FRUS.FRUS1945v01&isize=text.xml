NOTTER presented the second recommendation with regard to\na reference in the Charter to observance of treaties as an essential\ncondition of international order. He said that the French were in-\nsisting on a statement with regard to the observance of treaties as a\nkind of mandate. It was the opinion of our group that there should\nbe no other reference to this matter than in the Preamble and that\nthe subject should be separated from references to human rights.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN asked why it should not be included in the\nChapter on Purposes or Principles. REPRESENTATiVE BILOOM com-\nmented that if it was in the Preamble it has nothing to do with the\nCharter and if we want it to be effective we should put it in the\nChapter on Purposes. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE asked why it could not\nbe in the Chapter on Principles.\n  SENATOR VANDERBERG said there were so many dubious treaties in\nexistence, and more would be made in the near future, that we did not\nwant to be tied to a hard and fast support of all of them. He said\nthat was why he had tried to get into the Charter an authority to re-\nview treaties so that they could be changed peaceably. COMMANDER\nSTASsEN said that in any case we would want to respect treaties as long\nas they were in force. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said that the refer-\nence to observance of treaties would not be emphatic if it was only in\nthe Preamble and not anywhere else in the Charter.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG asked why the Committee of Five recom-\nmended that this reference be put only in the Preamble. MR. NoTTER\nsaid they could not figure out why the French were pushing so hard\nfor the statement, though he suspected it might be that they had their\neye on the mutual assistance treaty with Russia. SENATOR VANDEN-\nBERG said he agreed with that view of the situation. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN said that if the French were pressing for a statement in the\nChapter on Principles, it would be very difficult for anyone to be\nagainst it.\n  MR. JOHNSON asked whether the French Delegate in the Committee\nof Five agreed to recommend to his Delegation that they accept the\nproposal of the Committee of Five. Mn. BOWMAN asked that the\nexact wording of the French proposal be read. MR. NOTTER read the\namendment proposed by the French Government to Chapter I, para-\ngraph 1: 39 "to maintain international peace and security, in con-\nformity with right and justice, and to that end to take effective collec-\ntive measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace\nand suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace,\nand to bring about by peaceful means adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes which may lead to a breach of the peace,\nwhile bearing in mind that treaties bind those who have signed them\n  "D4-. 2.
