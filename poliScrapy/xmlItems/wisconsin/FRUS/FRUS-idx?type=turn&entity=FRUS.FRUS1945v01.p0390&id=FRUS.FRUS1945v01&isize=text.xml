He said that we felt it\nwould be a mistake to demand that five Poles other than the Lublin\nPoles be brought from inside Poland to Moscow as the Russians would\nnever agree to this. Any attempt to get them to do so would just be\nbutting our heads against a brick wall.\n  It was agreed to stand by the original message. During this dis-\ncussion, the Prime Minister called Mr. Eden and Mr. Eden advised\nthat the Prime Minister agreed with this position.\n  Mr. Eden stated that there was considerable risk that Mr. Miko-\nlaj"zyk would not proceed to Moscow at ailP-if the non-Lublin Poles\nselected from- Poland itself were not representative of the Polish\npeople. The Secretary and Mr. Dunn agreed that this presented a\nproblem. Mr. Eden stated that he might want some help from us\nto prod Mr. Mikolajczyk into going.

Mr. Dulles had told him that\nwhile a few weeks ago sixty percent of the religious organizations\nwere in favor of the Organization now it was only fifty-fifty. The\n\'Secretary suggested that Mr. Eden have his people brief himn on this.\n                          C. ARGENTINA\n  Mr. Eden asked the Secretary what the latest position was on\nArgentina. The Secretary said that we were in a difficult position\nat the moment because the Argentine\' Government had requested that\n  2 Telegram 899, April 17, 7 p. m., to Moscow, vol. v, p. 227.\n  27 Reference here is to a statement issued by the Archbishop and Bishops\nof\nthe Administrative Board of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, released\nApril 14, expressing doubt and fear about certain provisions in the proposed\nCharter, such as the voting procedure In the\' Security Council, deploring\nthe Polish\nproblem and the enslavement of the Baltic States, and calling for the re-\nestablishment of liberated European countries under genuine democratic regimes.\n328\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
