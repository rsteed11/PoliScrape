General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 133\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\n    10 delegates\n    12 advisers and experts\n    10 correspondents and cinema operators\n    90 assistants, secretaries, and staff, making a total of 122.\n  The Ambassador then went on to say that the number of persons\nwhich would compose the Ukrainian and White Russian Republics\nwould amount to a total of thirty persons, I remarked that no invi-\ntation had been issued to the Ukrainian and White Russian Republics\nto attend the Conference and that no provision had been made for\na delegation from those entities. The Ambassador then stated that\naccording to the agreement made at the Crimean- Conference,75 these\ntwo Republics were to be initial members of the International Or-\nganization, and that they would be expected therefore to be present\nat San Francisco and take their place among the participants in the\ndrawing up of the charter. I said that I was not familiar with the\ndetails of any arrangement which might have been made at the\nCrimean Conference in this respect, but that in my own opinion if\nthe two Republics were to be "initial members" of the new Organi-\nzation, I did not myself see how that would justify their being present\nat the Conference at San Francisco as they could not be "initial mem-\nbers" of an organization until the organization was itself constituted;\nand that of course the International Organization would not be consti-\ntuted and begin to function until at least a certain number of the sig-\nnatories to the charter had had their adherence to the charter ratified\naccording to their constitutional processes, and there had been an op-\nportunity to convene the representatives of the states which had joined\nthe Organization for the purpose of having its initial meeting. The\nAmbassador said that it was his understanding, and he believed that\nof his Government, that the agreement to consider these two Republics\nas having the right to "initial membership" entitled them to participate\nin the Conference at which the charter of the Organization would be\ndrawn up. He asked whether the representatives of the governments\nat the Conference would not have full powers and would not be ex-\npected to sign the charter in the name of their governments. I said\nthat that was our expectation, whereupon he gave as his opinion that\ninitial membership involved the signing of the charter as an -original\nmember of the Organization and that it was therefore necessary for\nthese two Republics to be present at the Conference to participate in\nthe discussions leading to the conclusion of the instrument or statute\nfounding the Organization and to exercise their rights as "initial\nmembers" of the Organization by signing the charter at San Fran-\n  7 Conferences at Malta and Yalta, p. 976;
