It might lead to independence. The word "in-\ndependence" however suggested full national independence and was\na provocative word. Our position, he explained, was based on the\nfeeling that we should not go beyond the area of agreement that was\npossible among the four powers. REPRESENTATIVE BLoom noted that\nMr. Stassen\'s speech to the Committee\'8 the previous day was one\nof the best he had ever heard and thought it should be distributed to\nthe members of the Delegation. MR. STASSEN pointed out that from\nour point of view the phrase "progressive development toward self-\ngovernment" covers independence. If one goes beyond that phrase\nthere was danger that we would be interpreted as butting in on\ncolonial affairs. This would mean that we were going beyond what\nwe were supposed to do at San Francisco.\n  MR. NoTTmr indicated that he would like to make a statement on\nthis question, although he recognized that it did not lie within his\nspecial field. The British and Russians, he felt, would be in an excel-\nlent position to take advantage of our opposition to the term "in-\ndependence". This position would be very unpopular in the Far East.\nTo take any position short of independence would simply not satisfy\nthe colonial peoples. If we maintained the present position we would\nbe spearheading for the British, Dutch, and Belgian colonial empires.\n  MR. TAussIG stated that he would like to read a brief memorandum\nthat he had prepared on this matter. MR. TAUSSIG then read as\nfollows:\n  "The issue of independence as an ultimate aim for dependent peo-\nples in the statement of objectives of the trustee system has been\nraised by the Chinese and the Russians who press their point, with\nvigor. The opposition has been offered by the British and the French.\nThe United States position, at the moment, leans toward the British\nand French views.\n  "This issue can have serious implications for the future relations\nbetween this country and the Far East in particular and with the\nworld\'s dependent peoples in general. I raise the question as to\nwhether it would not be better in this instance for the United States\nto support the Russian and Chinese position. This would be, so for\nthe following reasons:\n      " (1) Independence as a goal for all peoples who aspire to and\n    are capable of it has been the traditional and sacred policy of\n    this Government. It has been exemplified in our policy in the\n    Philippines, and it has been reiterated on numerous occasions by\n    President Roosevelt and former Secretary of State Cordell Hull.\n      " (2) An excellent opportunity is afforded to make a profitable\n    gesture on behalf of the peoples of the Orient as well as those in\n    Africa and the Caribbean.\n  "8Doc. 404, II/4/17, May 18, UNCIO Documents, vol. 10, p. 452;
