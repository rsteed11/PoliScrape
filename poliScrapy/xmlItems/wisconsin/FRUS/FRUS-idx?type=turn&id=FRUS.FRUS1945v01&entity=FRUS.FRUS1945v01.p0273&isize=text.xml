It was agreed that both the preliminary\ndiscussions and the negotiations at the Conference would be limited\nto principles and machinery and not embrace consideration of the\ndisposition of specific territories. We have formally invited repre-\nsentatives of the other four governments to Washington for the pre-\nliminary consultation. They have all accepted and several repre-\nsentatives are already here.\n  We have been working diligently with the War, Navy and Interior\nDepartments to develop an agreed U.S. Government position to sub-\nmit for your approval for use in these conversations. A Draft Pro-\nposal has been prepared which is summarized in Supplement I, at-\ntached, and given in full in Supplement 11,53 which is being sent\nseparately by pouch. This draft has not been approved by the Sec-\nretaries of War and Navy but we understand that with minor changes\nwe all could agree on this plan. The main difference between us is\nnot on the plan but on the question of considering trusteeship now.\n  The Secretaries of War and Navy are stating their position\nseparately.54 . As we understand their view, it is that this Government\nshould retain complete control over certain strategic areas in the\nPacific and that we should make this known unequivocally to other\nnations and to the world before participating in any discussions. The\nSecretaries of War and Navy stress that they are opposed to any\nimperialistic alinexation of territory on the part of the United States.\nOn the contrary, they believe that the United States policy should\nbe to hold any reserve strategic rights in a very real sense as trustee\nin the interests of the same cause for which we are now fighting-the\n  52Copy of telegram obtained from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde\nPark, N.Y. Transmitted by the White House Map Room to President Roosevelt\nat his home in Warm Springs, Ga. On April 10 the following message from the\nPresident to the Secretary oIf State was received by the White House Map\nRoom:\n  "Your message on International Trusteeship is approved in principle.\nI will\nsee your representative and that of the Army and Navy on the 19th. That will\nbe time enough. And if you have already left I will, of course, see you on\nthe\n25th."
