General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 417\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\npart of it. Mr. Stassen asked whether it would not be necessary as a\npreliminary step to Argentina\'s being invited to sit in on the Confer-\nence. The Secretary replied that Argentina would be satisfied with\nthis arrangement. Senator Connally asked why the United States\nwas so opposed to having Argentina sign the United Nations Declara-\ntion. The Secretary replied that sentimentally we oppose it. We\njust cannot let Argentina come in at the last minute on a Declaration\npledging full support to the war against the Axis when the Argentines\nhad not given such support. It would spoil the spirit of the Declara-\ntion and would not be well received by a great many of the countries\nthat had signed it in good faith.\n  Mr. Dulles asked whether the admission of Argentina without its\nsigning the United Nations Declaration would open the way to de-\nmands from the other states that had not been invited to the Confer-\n,ence. The Secretary replied that it undoubtedly would have that\nresult. He was sure, for example, that Representative Marcantonio 83\nwould make a long speech in the House about the fact that Italy was\nleft out. There might be serious repercussions on American public\nopinion. Mr. Dulles said that he personally would not oppose having\nthe Conference at the end become more universal in its membership.\nThe Secretary said that it would be difficult to do that because if\nSwitzerland and Portugal were invited, for example, the U.S.S.R.\nwould object strongly. Moreover, he said that there was a distinc-\ntion-that Argentina had declared war and was not a neutral country.\n  The Secretary then asked each of the Delegates for concurrence in\nthe decisions about Argentina and the Soviet Republics. Senator\nVandenberg said that the Secretary should proceed as he thought best,\nalthough his own position remained as it was. Mr. Stassen said it\nwould be very important to delay the matter of inviting the Ukraine\nand White Russia to the Conference in order to give time for the prep-\naration of American opinion. Senator Vandenberg asked what we\nwere going to get in exchange for, our concession on this point, and\nMr. Stassen replied that we would get the basis for insisting that the\nSoviet Government should follow through on Poland. Senator Van-\ndenberg said he hoped we would not go through the same process with\nregard to Poland, of giving in at the last moment. The Secretary\nsaid that he thought there was no danger of that, especially since he\nhad seen the President\'s telegram on Poland.34 He stated that there\nwas a serious crisis now, in which the United States had to make this\nconcession in order to keep the Soviet Government in the Conference.\nMr. Armstrong said he thought it would be most important to get a\ndelay on the request for seating representatives of the two Soviet Re-\n3\'Representative Vito Marcantonlo, of New York City.\n"Message of April 23 handed to Mr. Molotov by President Truman for trans-\nmission to Marshal Stalin, vol. v, p. 258.\n417\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
