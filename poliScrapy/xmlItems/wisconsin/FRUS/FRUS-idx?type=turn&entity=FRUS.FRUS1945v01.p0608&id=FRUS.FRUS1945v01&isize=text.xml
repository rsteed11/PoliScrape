DEAN\nGILDERSLEEVE said that this would weaken the Economic and Social\nCouncil.\n  MR. PASvOLSEY said there was no real objection to mentioning the\nILO as an existing organization which should be brought into re-\nlation with the Organization. MR. DULLES said that we did not, how-\never, wish to give the ILO priority over the Economic and Social\nCouncil. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked what the effect would be if\nthe British made this proposal and the United States opposed it, and\nespecially what the effect would be on American labor. MR.

PAsvoLsKY read the proposed amendment to paragraph 3 of\nChapter I. [After "humanitarian problems" insert "and encourage-\nment of respect for human rights in particular the right to work and\nthe right to education and also for fundamental freedoms for all with-\nout distinction as to race, language, religion or sex."]\n  MR. BOWMAN said that it contained everything but the right to be\nassassinated. MR.
