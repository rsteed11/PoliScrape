General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 534\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nSECRETARY said that the American Delegation could take a public\nstand after tonight.\n  THE SECRETARY referred to a letter on the subject of education which\nhad been brought up at the Consultants\' meeting [U.S. Gen 52].62\nMR. MAcLEISH asked that the whole letter be read and Mr. SANDIFER\nTead it. REPRESENTATIVE EATON said this was a very important\ndocument and he wanted to come back to the Russian proposal for\namending paragraph 3 of Chapter I "in particular the right to work".\nHe wondered whose duty it was to implement this right. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG said he was surprised that the Russians had not sug-\ngested the right to strike, also. REPRESENTATIVE EATON said that was\nreally a part of what they wanted. He still wanted to know whose\nduty it was to provide the work.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY said he felt that while we must be sympathetic\nwith these proposals, he dreaded trying to cover too much. If this is\nincluded, the other countries want other things. Education has as\nmany connotations as religion. He was merely uttering a word of\ncaution.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said he wished to raise a point of order\nagainst the whole discussion. The Delegation had decided not to in-\nclude the word "education", and he thought that the one sure way\nto\nmeet with trouble in Congress was to include it. He recalled that the\nSenators had been for omitting this word also. THE SECRETARY\nasked whether we could accept this word as a proposal of the Soviet\nDelegation. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM thought that would be some-\nwhat better. SENATOR VANDENBERG said he thought the language\nsuggested by the American Delegation already expressed the spirit\nof this letter.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked why it would not be better to talk\nabout equality. He thought "human rights"\' means nothing. MIR.\nDILLES asked Representative Bloom if he would be satisfied with the\nSoviet formula "without distinction as to race, language, religion or\nsex". Representative Bloom said he thought it did not have quite the\nsame meaning.\n  THE SECRETARY said that it was now 9: 30 in Washington and it was\ntime for him to telephone to the President.\n  MR. BOWMAN said that at two meetings the advisers had been in-\nvited and urged to make their suggestions. MR. PASVOLSKY said he\nthought it was now too late for anything further, and whatever de-\ncisions were to be made would have to be made here. DEAN GILDER-\nSLEEVE asked whether this would apply to Chapter IX since this was\nthe first occasion on which there would be an opportunity to decide.\n" Not printed.
