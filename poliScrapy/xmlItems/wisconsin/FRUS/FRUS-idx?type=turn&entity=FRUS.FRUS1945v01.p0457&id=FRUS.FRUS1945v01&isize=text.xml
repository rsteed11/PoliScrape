Senator Con-\nnally thought it was rather awkward to tie in the announcement of\ncarrying out the Yalta agreement with the statement that we would\nnot invite the two republics to attend the Conference.\n  Senator Vandenberg thought that any statement now, until- we\ncould produce something that we had gained in the bargain, would\ninvite public opposition. Ambassador Harriman indicated that he\nwould like nothing better than to have the people rise up in protest\nand indicate their real position, since it would be good for the Soviets\nto appreciate for once the reaction of the American people which he\nhad been for such a long time trying to convey to them.\n  After a brief discussion, it was agreed by Mr. Pasvolsky and Mr.\nRaynor that the Delegation had not yet announced its own view on\nthe Soviet proposal.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky pointed out that there was a real difference of inter-\npretation of the Yalta agreement between the Russians and ourselves.\nWhile we were committed to admitting the two Russian republics to\nmembership in the Organization, this meant to us listing them in the\nannex as initial members of the Organization. From our point of\nview the question of participation in the Conference did not arise at\nYalta and is not now involved. The Russian interpretation, on the\nother hand, was that admission as original members of the Organiza-\ntion implied the right to send representatives to the Conference itself.\nMr. Pasvolsky noted that there would be no problem of timing if we\nwere merely listing the Soviet republics in the annex, but the reason\nthat the Russians were pressing the matter was that they wanted to\nget the two Soviet Republics represented in the Conference. Ambas-\nsador Harriman commented that the agreement at Yalta did not imply\nthe seating of the two republics in the Conference. Mr. Pasvolsky\nsaid that it would be tremendously difficult to avoid doing this if we\nlived up to our own interpretation of the Yalta agreement. Senator\nVandenberg replied that if we yielded on the Russian proposal at all\nit did not much matter whether we seated the states at the Conference\nor whether we did not. Mr. Pasvolsky thought that the preferable\nposition was to say that we did not intend to seat the two republics\nat the Conferenice.
