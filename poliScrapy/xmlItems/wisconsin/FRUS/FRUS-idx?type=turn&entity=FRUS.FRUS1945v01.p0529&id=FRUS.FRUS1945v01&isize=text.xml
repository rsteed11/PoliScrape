General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 467\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENTCE\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said that if any other word besides "cultur-\nal" was used, that is any specific term, the other specific terms would\nhave to be added. He thought it usually better to keep to more gen-\neral formulas. For example, Congress under the Constitution was\ngiven the right to regulate Post Offices and Post Roads and because\nof that had been able to deal with a great many specific matters.\nThus, he thought it better to use a broad term and interpret it to\ninclude science, arts, and education. He had one further example.\nWhen Congress was considering a proposal to finance the committee\nfor the preservation of the monuments of Europe, there was a great\ndeal of misunderstanding until it was explained that this term covered\nart treasures, museum objects, etc. He cited this as an illustration\nof how difficult it is to work with certain words. He was sure that if\nthe word "education" was in the Charter, there would be a fight\nin\nCongress. ;\n- MR. MACLEISH said he had been a member of the Delegation to the\neducation meeting in London last year and had been living with his\n[this?] problem for some time. He was reluctant to make any sugges-\ntions on the subject of public pressure, knowing what the members of\nCongress felt on this matter. He would like, however, to underline\nwhat Mr. Hovde had said. The American people feel strongly on the\nsubject of education, and there is a considerable body of opinion and a\ntremendous support for proposals that lie in the educational field.\nOne aspect of the problem was that the people of the United States,\nhaving seen that education had been used as a weapon by the Nazis,\nnow believe that this tendency could not be left uncombatted. He\nthought that the difficulties were obvious, and it was a problem how\nto deal substantively with the problem in any terms. The matter\ncould be approached in terms of interchanging the instruments of\neducation, that is, technical information, documentary films, books,\nnew developments and the techniques of education everywhere. Then\nwe could favor an international organization to exchange information\nabout advances in these fields, and circulate reports on developments\nin different countries. However, it would be difficult and dangerous\nto ignore the fact that in many minds, education has been abused; and\nif we really intend to stop war, we must begin to do so and not refuse\nto take necessary steps in all fields. He would agree that one general\nword was better than several specific terms. The word "culture\'&gt;\nis\nsuspect in America, but there is no substitute for it. He thought it\nwould be better to take the general term and develop it in statements\nafterwards. He spoke of plans for establishing a special international\norganization for education and cultural cooperation, which would\nencourage the interchange of knowledge and techniques and throw\nlight on the developments of education in various countries.
