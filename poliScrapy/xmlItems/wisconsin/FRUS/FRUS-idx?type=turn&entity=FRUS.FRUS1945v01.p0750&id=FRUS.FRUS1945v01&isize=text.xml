General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 688\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\n  MR. STINCKowm stated that the issue also arises with respect to the\nCommissions which were to be set up under the Economic and Social\nCouncil, one of which will be on education.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG inquired whether, if the word "educational"\nis to be used, there would be any way to make it clear that American\neducational autonomy is not subject to any outside interference\nwhatever.\n  DEAN GiIwERsmviF] explained that she and M. Bonnet were in\nagreement. The French would like to use the word "intellectual",\nbut the specific vote, if it comes, will be on the word "educational".\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG stated that he would have no objection to its\ninclusion if there were some qualification that is explicit with refer-\nence to domestic jurisdiction.\n  MIP. DuLLus stated that this is clear in the Charter; nothing con-\ntained in the Charter can interfere with domestic jurisdiction.\n  MR. ARMSTRONG said that if the word "cultural" includes education,\nscience and other fields, he was agreeable to the word "cultural".\nDEAN GiLDmzsLsvE said that if "cultural" does not include "educa-\ntional", why then should we avoid the word, but that she was never-\ntheless prepared to hold to the word "cultural". She said that\nother\nfields such as health had also been proposed for specific mention.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG believed that we should say precisely what\nwe mean, and make it clear that we do not contemplate interference\nwith domestic affairs. He said that it was not possible to get UNRRA\nthrough the Senate until Congress was satisfied that there would\nbe no control over education or domestic affairs. Dean Gildersleeve\nsaid that in the Committee she would follow the American position\nand speak regarding our interest in education, but that she would\noppose specific inclusion of the word. She said that the Canadian\ndraft "9 included neither the words "educational" or "cultural",\nand\nthat we could probably get the Canadian draft accepted with the\nword "cultural" added. This would be the simplest method.\n  MR. STINEBOWER pointed out that possible interference of the Or-\nganization in domestic affairs could be avoided if its actions were\nlimited by words such as "the Organization should encourage separate\nand cooperative actions". SENATOR VANDENBERG liked these words\nand believed they should be inserted so as to apply broadly to all\nactivities of the Organization that were under discussion.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE then referred to the Canadian proposals (Doc-\nument 157, p. 8 80) which included as an objective "attaining of higher\nstandards of living and economic and social progress and develop-\nment", asking whether this amendment was acceptable. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN pointed out that it went no farther than the Atlantic Char-\n  7DoC. 2, G/14(t), May 6, UNCIO Documents, vol , p. 589.\n  80 Doe. 157, II/3/5, May 9, ibid., vol. 10, pp. 306-7.\n688\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0749&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0749&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0750&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
