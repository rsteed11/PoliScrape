Citing the Foreign Relations series







Citing the Foreign Relations series
The Office of the Historian offers the following general recommendations for citing documents
                    in the Foreign Relations of the United States series. Your style guide may require
                    different formatting of a citation, so you may need to adapt the elements of the sample
                    citations below to a specific format.
Cite document numbers rather than page numbers
Every document in the Foreign Relations series since the 1955&#8211;57 subseries has been
                    assigned a sequential number unique within the volume. The advantage of citing a Foreign
                        Relations document by its document number is that, unlike page numbers, the numbers
                    are media neutral and remain consistent across different media: print, web, and ebook. An
                    example of a citation to document number is as follows:
Foreign Relations
                        of the United States, 1969&#8211;1976, Volume XIX, Part 1, Korea, 1969&#8211;1972, eds. Daniel
                    J. Lawler and Erin R. Mahan (Washington: Government Printing Office, 2010), Document
                    75.
The components of this citation are as follows:

Series title: Foreign Relations of the United States

Subseries title: 1969&#8211;1976
Volume number: Volume XIX, Part 1
Volume title: Korea, 1969&#8211;1972
Editors (not to include the General Editor): Daniel J. Lawler and Erin R. Mahan
City: Washington, D.C.
Publisher: Government Printing Office
Year published: 2010
Location within the volume: Document 75

Cite volumes by URL
Particularly if you consulted the web or ebook edition of a Foreign Relations
                    volume, we recommend appending the canonic URL for the volume (or document) to your
                    reference. This will allow readers to directly access the source. Taking the previous
                    citation as an example, the following URL would be appended to the end of the citation,
                    often including a date the material was accessed:
http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v19p1/d75 [accessed 27 Oct
                    2011]
URLs to Foreign Relations documents always follow this structure: the Office of the
                    Historian&#8217;s website domain (&#8220;http://history.state.gov&#8221;), section (&#8220;historicaldocuments&#8221;),
                    volume identifier (&#8220;frus1969-76v19p1&#8221;), and document identifier (&#8220;d75&#8221;).
A scanned image of the original printed page (or scanned document, in the case of certain electronic-only
                    volumes) is available for citation by URL. You can find these URLs in the right sidebar of
                    each document, labeled "View Image." For example, the sidebar for document 75 contains links to
                    the images of pages 190, 191, and 192. Notice that in these
                    page-number-based URLs, the document identifier (&#8220;d75&#8221;) is substituted with the page number
                    identifier (&#8220;pg_190&#8221;, etc.).
Citations to ebook editions are no different for these examples.
When citing a document number is not possible
Since volumes before the 1955&#8211;57 subseries did not include document numbers, citations must
                    reference page numbers:
Foreign Relations
                        of the United States, 1952&#8211;1954, General: Economic and Political Matters, Volume I,
                    Part 1, eds. David M. Baehler, Herbert A. Fine, Ralph R. Goodwin, N. Stephen Kane, Ronald D.
                    Landa, Lisle A. Rose, William F. Sanford, Jr., and Ilana M. Stern (Washington: Government
                    Printing Office, 1983), 798&#8211;800.
Document numbers have been superimposed on the web and ebook edition of all these earlier
                    volumes that have been digitized, so that every document has a unique URL. But take caution
                    that readers of the print edition will not be able to locate a citation in these volumes by
                    document number (e.g., the web edition of the above citation appears as &#8220;Document 221&#8221;). 
Variations in the titles of early Foreign Relations volumes
Early editions of the Foreign Relations series used a variety of titles. For
                    example:
Papers Relating
                        to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1918, Russia, Volume III
                    (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1932), 51.
Papers Relating
                        to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1893 (Washington: Government
                    Printing Office, 1894), 452&#8211;453.
Message of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the
                        Commencement of the Third Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress (Washington:
                    Government Printing Office, 1862), 356&#8211;370.
(For more information on the titles, see the discussion of the term &#8220;Foreign
                        Relations series&#8221; in the history of the Foreign Relations series.)
Also, earlier volumes typically do not identify the editors, in which case the names of
                    editors can not be included in a citation.
