Somalia, 1992&#8211;1993






Milestones: 1993&#8211;2000








Somalia, 1992&#8211;1993
The United States has long had to face the challenge of determining to what
                    degree it wants to participate in global peacekeeping efforts and whether or not
                    U.S. lives should be put at risk for peacekeeping. Events in Somalia between
                    1992 and 1994 threw that debate into sharp relief.

Somalia achieved its independence in 1960 with the union of Somalia, which had
                    been under Italian administration as a United Nations trust territory, and
                    Somaliland, which had been a British protectorate. The United States immediately
                    established diplomatic relations with the new country. In 1969, the Somali Army
                    launched a coup which brought Mohamed Siad Barre to power.
                    Barre adopted socialism and became allied with the Soviet Union. The United
                    States was thus wary of Somalia in the period immediately after the coup.
Barre&#8217;s government became increasingly radical in foreign affairs, and in 1977
                    launched a war against Ethiopia in hopes of claiming their territory. Ethiopia
                    received help from the Soviet Union during the war, and so Somalia began to
                    accept assistance from the United States, giving a new level of stability to the
                    U.S.-Somalia relationship. 
Barre&#8217;s dictatorship favored members of his own clan. In the 1980s, Somalis in
                    less favored clans began to chafe under the government&#8217;s rule. Barre&#8217;s
                    ruthlessness could not suppress the opposition, which in 1990 began to unify
                    against him. After joining forces, the combined group of rebels drove Barre from
                    Mogadishu in January 1991. No central government reemerged to take the place of
                    the overthrown government, and the United States closed its embassy that same
                    year, although the two countries never broke off diplomatic relations. The
                    country descended into chaos, and a humanitarian crisis of staggering
                    proportions began to unfold.
The United Nations attempted to address the crisis with United Nations Operation
                    in Somalia (UNOSOM) to provide humanitarian assistance, created by the United
                    Nations Security Council via Resolution 751 in April 1992. The United States
                    sent food aid via Operation Provide Comfort starting in August 1992. Intense
                    fighting between the warlords impeded the delivery of aid to those who needed it
                    most, and so the United Nations contemplated stronger action. In December 1992,
                    the United States began Operation Restore Hope. President George H.W.
                        Bush authorized the dispatch of U.S. troops to Somalia to assist
                    with famine relief as part of the larger United Nations effort. The United
                    Nations&#8217; United Task Force (UNITAF) operated under the authority of Chapter VII
                    of the U.N. Charter. Chapter VII allowed for the use of force to maintain peace
                    and did not require the consent of the states involved. UNITAF transitioned to
                    UNOSOM II in March 1993. UNOSOM II&#8217;s efforts to protect aid deliveries were
                    directly challenged by warlord Muhammad Farah Aideed.

The most significant of these challenges came on October 3, 1993. Aideed&#8217;s forces
                    shot down two Black Hawk helicopters in a battle which lead to the deaths of 18
                    U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Somalis. The deaths turned the tide of public
                    opinion in the United States. President Bill Clinton pulled U.S. troops out of
                    combat four days later, and all U.S. troops left the country in March 1994. The
                    United Nations withdrew from Somalia in March 1995. Fighting continued in the
                    country.
At the same time the Somalia crisis was unfolding, President Clinton ordered the
                    national security bureaucracy to consider how and when the United States should
                    become involved in peacekeeping operations. The resulting document was
                    Presidential Decision Directive 25, issued on May 3, 1994. The Directive
                    outlined a series of factors which the national security bureaucracy must
                    consider before involving the United States in peacekeeping: eight factors which
                    must be weighed before deciding in favor of peacekeeping in the United Nations,
                    and nine additional factors before becoming involved in a Chapter VII
                    action.
Although the United Nations&#8217; involvement in Somalia was unable to provide a
                    solution to the country&#8217;s political crisis, the United States remained engaged
                    in responding to the humanitarian needs of the Somali people, and continued to
                    be a significant source of bilateral aid.
