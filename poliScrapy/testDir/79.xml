The Madrid Conference, 1991






Milestones: 1989&#8211;1992








The Madrid Conference, 1991
On March 6, 1991, President George H. W. Bush told Congress,
                    &#8220;The time has come to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict.&#8221; Bush&#8217;s
                    declaration was followed by eight months of intensive shuttle diplomacy by
                    Secretary of State James Baker, culminating in the Madrid
                    Peace Conference in October 1991. The Conference, co-chaired by Bush and Soviet
                    President Mikhail Gorbachev, was attended by Israeli,
                    Egyptian, Syrian, and Lebanese delegations, as well as a joint
                    Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. For the first time, all of the parties to the
                    Arab-Israeli conflict had gathered to hold direct negotiations&#8212;a historically
                    unprecedented event.

The Conference&#8217;s long-term impact, however, was more limited than the Bush
                    administration had hoped. Following Madrid, Israeli, Syrian, Jordanian, and
                    Palestinian representatives continued to meet for bilateral talks in Washington,
                    and multilateral talks commenced in Moscow in 1992. Yet by 1993, the Washington
                    talks had become deadlocked and were overtaken by secret Israeli-Palestinian and
                    Israeli-Jordanian negotiations, which produced the Israeli-Palestinian
                    Declaration of Principles (the so-called &#8220;Oslo Accord&#8221;) of September 1993 and
                    the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty of October 1994.
From the Intifada to Madrid 

The United States began trying to convene an international Middle East peace
                    conference during the final year of Ronald Reagan&#8217;s
                    Presidency. In December 1987, the Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza
                    Strip had risen up against Israeli military rule. Hoping to stop the violence
                    and address Palestinian grievances, Secretary of State George
                        Shultz called for an international convention that would serve as
                    a prelude to direct negotiations between Israel, Jordan, and local Palestinians
                    on interim autonomy for the occupied territories, followed by talks on a
                    permanent status agreement. Shultz&#8217;s plan, however, went nowhere. Israel
                    rejected the Secretary&#8217;s proposals because they did not call for an end to the
                    Palestinian uprising, or intifada,as a precondition to
                    negotiations. In July 1988, Jordan&#8217;s King Hussein rendered the Shultz Plan
                    unworkable when he renounced his kingdom&#8217;s links to the West Bank.
Throughout 1989&#8211;1990, U.S. peacemaking efforts centered on a plan put forward by
                    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which called for the
                    Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect representatives who would
                    negotiate interim arrangements for self-governance with Israel, followed by a
                    permanent status agreement. U.S. and Egyptian efforts to build on this proposal
                    ultimately faltered over Israel&#8217;s insistence on vetting potential Palestinian
                    candidates for ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In March
                    1990, controversy over how to proceed with Shamir&#8217;s plan led to the fall of
                    Israel&#8217;s national unity government, putting diplomacy on hold. The failure of
                    the plan, combined with sharp U.S.-Israeli exchanges over Israeli
                    settlement-building in the occupied territories, strained relations between Bush
                    and Shamir. However, American efforts to bring the PLO into the peace process
                    fared no better. In November 1988, the PLO finally met U.S. demand that it
                    renounce terrorism and accept U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338,
                    which called for Arab-Israeli peace and mutual recognition accompanied by
                    Israeli withdrawal from &#8220;territories&#8221; it had occupied in 1967. Nevertheless,
                    diplomatic contacts between the two sides remained at a low level and were cut
                    off in June 1990, when Chairman Yasir Arafat refused to condemn a terrorist
                    attack perpetrated by the Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction.
By March 1991, the Persian Gulf War had created a more favorable context for
                    American peacemaking efforts. The Bush administration&#8217;s successful military
                    campaign against Iraq left the President enormously popular at home, and
                    highlighted America&#8217;s increasingly dominant role in a post-Cold War Middle East.
                    The Soviet Union had not strongly opposed American intervention, and Arab
                    states, including former Soviet client Syria, joined the coalition against
                    Saddam Hussein. At the same time, the administration felt a need to reward its
                    Arab partners for their support by pushing for progress on the Palestinian
                    issue. Since the PLO backed Iraq during the war, it had alienated Egypt, Syria,
                    and most of the Gulf States, and lost influence over Palestinians in the
                    occupied territories. The Bush administration thus had an opportunity to bring
                    Palestinians into the diplomatic process under conditions that the Israelis
                    might accept.
Between March and October 1991, Baker succeeded in getting Arab leaders and
                    Palestinian representatives from the occupied territories to drop their demands
                    that PLO officials and Palestinians from East Jerusalem participate in an
                    international peace conference. Instead, the Arab parties agreed that the
                    Palestinians would only be represented by delegates from the occupied
                    territories, and as part of a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation.
                    Simultaneously, Baker and Bush put pressure on Shamir to drop Israel&#8217;s
                    insistence on bilateral negotiations by withholding $10 billion in loan
                    guarantees that he had requested to help settle Jewish immigrants from the
                    Soviet Union. The President insisted that Shamir would have to promise that the
                    funds would not be used to finance new settlement activity in the occupied
                    territories. Shamir refused to accept Bush&#8217;s demand, but it undoubtedly played a
                    role in his decision to come to Madrid.
The Conference and its Aftermath

The Madrid Conference opened October 30, 1991, and ended on November 4. Though
                    the parties largely stuck to their traditional positions and did not negotiate
                    seriously with each other, they nevertheless agreed to remain in dialogue.
                    Bilateral talks between Israeli officials and their Arab counterparts would
                    begin in Washington in December 1991, while multilateral negotiations began in
                    Moscow in January 1992. From the beginning, the bilateral talks were generally
                    regarded as the more significant of the two tracks. While these talks acquired
                    greater momentum following the election of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
                    in June 1992, they failed to yield results before the Clinton administration
                    took office. Ultimately, the Israeli-Jordanian and Israeli-Palestinian tracks
                    established at Madrid would be circumvented by the parties themselves.
                    Frustrated by the Palestinian delegation&#8217;s inability to move forward without
                    Arafat&#8217;s approval, the Israelis decided to negotiate directly with the PLO,
                    culminating in the signing of the Declaration of Principles on September 13,
                    1993. King Hussein and the Israelis likewise decided to move forward
                    independently of the Madrid framework, holding direct talks which produced a
                    peace treaty by October 1994.
