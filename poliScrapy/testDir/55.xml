About Us

Who We Are
The Office of the Historian is staffed by professional historians who are experts
                            in the history of U.S. foreign policy and the Department of State and possess
                            unparalleled research experience in classified and unclassified government
                            records. The Office&#8217;s historians work closely with other federal government
                            history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the
                            globe. The Office is directed by Dr. Stephen
                                Randolph, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.


What We Do
The Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and
                            publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the
                            Foreign Relations of the United States series.
In addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for
                            Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential
                            background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify
                            precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on
                            institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make
                            decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their
                            choices. The Office of the Historian conducts an array of initiatives, ranging
                            from briefing memos to multi-year research projects.
The Office of the Historian also promotes the declassification of documents to
                            ensure a complete and accurate understanding of the past.


Foreign Relations of the United States

The Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series presents the official
                            documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions. The series
                            began in 1861 and now comprises more than 480 individual volumes.
Foreign Relations volumes contain documents from the Presidential libraries,
                            Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central
                            Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign
                            affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in
                            implementing U.S. foreign policy.
Learn more about the series and view the collection at our Historical Documents page.


Our Outreach Activities
The Office&#8217;s public outreach activities include hosting scholarly conferences on
                            key issues in the history of U.S. foreign policy, answering historical research
                            questions, consulting with scholars, educators, and students, and working with
                            high school teachers across the country to provide high-quality materials for
                            classroom use.


How to Access Our Materials
The Office maintains a public website at history.state.gov,
                            which provides in-depth information to the public on the history of U.S. foreign
                            policy. In addition to a full text archive of
                                the Foreign Relations series, the website includes valuable
                            encyclopedic content on the history of U.S. relations
                                with states around the world, a database of the Department&#8217;s principal officers and
                                chiefs of mission, and special tools and
                                resources for students and teachers.
In keeping with the Open Government Directive&#8217;s principle of transparency,
                            participation, and collaboration as the cornerstone of an open government, the
                            Office of the Historian has begun preparing many of its rich historical
                            publications in a raw data format that can be accessed through data.gov. Please
                            visit our Open Government page to learn more about
                            these resources.
