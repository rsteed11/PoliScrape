U.S.-Soviet Relations, 1981&#8211;1991






Milestones: 1981&#8211;1988








U.S.-Soviet Relations, 1981&#8211;1991
The period 1981&#8211;1991 witnessed a dramatic transformation in the relationship
                    between the United States and the Soviet Union. During these years the specter
                    of a nuclear war between the superpowers receded as the Cold War ended swiftly,
                    nearly entirely peacefully, and on U.S. terms.

Gorbachev, Reagan, and Bush in New York City, December 1988. (Ronald
                        Reagan Presidential Library)

When Ronald Reagan became president in January 1981, such outcomes were
                    inconceivable. The Soviets had invaded Afghanistan, causing President Jimmy
                    Carter to withdraw a strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT II) from Senate
                    ratification, boycott the 1980 Olympics Games in Moscow, and ban U.S. grain
                    sales to Moscow. D&#233;tente&#8212;or, &#8220;relaxation of tensions&#8221;&#8212;yielded to
                    confrontation.
Committed to restoring U.S. strength and reversing strategic imbalances real and
                    perceived, President Reagan pursued a comprehensive modernization of U.S.
                    nuclear and conventional forces and attempted to roll back communism in South
                    America, Africa, and South Asia. At the same time, he wrote to Soviet leaders
                    Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, and Konstantin Chernenko, imploring them to
                    alleviate Cold War tensions and negotiate arms reductions. He lifted the grain
                    embargo as a show of good faith, but the crackdown on Solidarity and declaration
                    of martial law in Poland in December 1981 led the President to declare further
                    economic sanctions against Moscow and curtail U.S.-Soviet academic
                    exchanges.
Although formal nuclear arms control talks resumed, the relationship between
                    Washington and Moscow remained tense throughout Reagan&#8217;s first term. The
                    President spoke of leaving &#8220;Marxism-Leninism on the ash-heap of history;&#8221;
                    labeled the Soviet Union an &#8220;evil empire;&#8221; and introduced the Strategic Defense
                    Initiative (&#8220;Star Wars&#8221;), which Soviet leaders found highly threatening. The
                    nadir of this time period was the fall of 1983, when the Soviets shot down
                    Korean Airlines Flight 007 over the Sea of Japan, NATO deployed a new generation
                    of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe, and Soviet negotiators
                    walked out of arms control talks in Geneva.
Reagan&#8217;s top advisers disagreed about Soviet strategies. Secretary of Defense
                    Caspar Weinberger was deeply skeptical of arms control. Secretary of State
                    George Shultz believed that agreements would enhance U.S. security. The
                    President seldom intervened to resolve such disputes, yet he shared Shultz&#8217;s
                    enthusiasm for establishing a dialogue on human rights&#8212;in particular, the plight
                    of religious and political dissidents&#8212;as a central focus of U.S.-Soviet
                    negotiations. In January 1984, he delivered an eloquent speech, drafted by his
                    Soviet aide Jack Matlock, which imagined the human connections that fictional
                    American and Soviet couples could forge if left to their own devices.
The March 1985 appointment of Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the
                    Communist Party of the Soviet Union provided Reagan with a viable negotiating
                    partner. A series of summits and high-profile encounters followed. At Reykjavik
                    in October 1986, Reagan and Gorbachev discussed the prospect of abolishing all
                    nuclear weapons. In December 1987 they signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
                    Forces Treaty, which eliminated an entire class of missiles. In May 1988,
                    standing in the middle of Red Square in Moscow, Reagan declared that the term
                    &#8220;evil empire&#8221; belonged to &#8220;another era.&#8221;
Fearful that Reagan had moved too quickly to accept Gorbachev&#8217;s good intentions
                    and the feasibility of his economic and political agenda (&#8220;Perestroika&#8221; and
                    &#8220;Glasnost&#8221;), President George H.W. Bush ordered a strategic review to reassess
                    U.S. objectives toward the Soviet Union in the first months of 1989.
                    Simultaneously, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Brent
                    Scowcroft reiterated that the Cold War was not over, and Secretary of Defense
                    Richard Cheney publicly stated that Gorbachev&#8217;s reforms were destined to
                    fail.
These statements aggravated Gorbachev, yet the pause did not derail the
                    constructive relationship between Washington and Moscow. Gorbachev accommodated
                    as revolutions occurred in Central and Eastern Europe that fall. After Bush met
                    with his Soviet counterpart off the coast of Malta in December 1989, one month
                    after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gorbachev&#8217;s spokesman declared, &#8220;We buried
                    the Cold War at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.&#8221; In the months that
                    followed, Bush worked with the Soviet leader to allow for the peaceful
                    reunification of Germany within NATO, to sign the Conventional Forces in Europe
                    (CFE) treaty and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), and to enable the
                    transition to democratically-elected governments in countries emerging from
                    Communist rule.
The starkest example of the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations came after
                    Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The Iraqi regime had previously
                    been a Soviet client and Gorbachev vigorously opposed the use of force to turn
                    back Saddam; yet Gorbachev did not stand in Washington&#8217;s way. Secretary of State
                    James Baker, who had been Reagan&#8217;s chief of staff in 1981, recalled the fall of
                    1990 as &#8220;the world turned upside down.&#8221;
As Gorbachev&#8217;s economic reforms foundered and his political base crumbled in
                    1991, the Bush administration increasingly engaged Russian President Boris
                    Yeltsin. Yeltsin turned back a coup against Gorbachev in August 1991, but in
                    subsequent months consolidated authority over political and military
                    institutions, and increasingly supported Russian independence and dissolution of
                    the Soviet Union. On the evening of December 25, after speaking to Gorbachev on
                    the telephone, Bush addressed the nation from the Oval Office to announce that
                    the Soviet Union had ceased to exist.
