Denuclearization and the Two Koreas, 1993&#8211;2001






Milestones: 1993&#8211;2000








Denuclearization and the Two Koreas, 1993&#8211;2001
The end of the Cold War altered the Korean Peninsula&#8217;s diplomatic landscape. The
                    Republic of Korea (South Korea) established diplomatic relations with the
                    longstanding allies of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (North Korea):
                    the Soviet Union, in 1990, and China, in 1992. In 1991 both Koreas were
                    simultaneously admitted into the U.N. These developments, together with North
                    Korea&#8217;s worsening economy and growing need for international aid, opened up the
                    possibility of a thaw in relations, with negotiations over reunification between
                    the two Koreas and normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations.
                    Denuclearization, a key aim of U.S. diplomacy, was at the heart of a series of
                    crises on the Korean Peninsula throughout the Clinton Administration.

There were signs of hope in early steps toward denuclearization. In January 1992,
                    North Korea publicly committed to signing the nuclear safeguards agreement with
                    the U.N.&#8217;s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to permitting
                    inspections of its primary nuclear facility at Yongbyon. In April of the same
                    year, the North and South signed the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization
                    of the Korean Peninsula, which barred the parties from developing or acquiring
                    nuclear weapons and limited them to using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes
                    only.
However, North Korea&#8217;s refusal throughout 1992 and 1993 to cease and disclose its
                    nuclear activities at Yongbyon, in defiance of IAEA agreements and directives,
                    and its threat to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, initiated
                    a series of crises. With the credibility of this Treaty in question and its
                    forthcoming renewal thrown into question, the United States threatened to call
                    upon the U.N. Security Council to issue an ultimatum threatening North Korea
                    with economic sanctions. Tensions subsided by June 1993, when the United States
                    and North Korea issued a joint statement affirming the principle of respect for
                    each other&#8217;s sovereignty and noninterference in each other&#8217;s internal
                    affairs.
The parties returned to negotiations, but these, too, faltered as North Korea
                    resisted IAEA inspections. By March 1994, North Korean diplomats threatened war
                    if the United States and South Korea went to the U.N. In May North Korea
                    withdrew from the IAEA. A last-minute private trip to North Korea by President
                    Jimmy Carter in June 1994 averted war and led to U.S.-North Korean bilateral
                    negotiations and the October 1994 Agreed Framework for the denuclearization of
                    North Korea.
The Agreed Framework was a staged, multilateral agreement involving the two
                    Koreas, the United States, and Japan. It required Pyongyang to halt its nuclear
                    activities at Yongbyon, allow IAEA monitors in, and eventually dismantle the
                    facility. In exchange, the United States, Japan, and South Korea would provide
                    light water reactors, and the United States would provide interim energy
                    supplies in the form of fuel-oil. Each stage was to build confidence that the
                    parties were willing to continue.
In carrying out the agreement, however, numerous setbacks eroded trust among the
                    parties. While the United States followed through on its promises to ship
                    fuel-oil, the U.S. Congress delayed the deliveries. The 1997 IMF Crisis limited
                    the ability of South Korea to contribute to the construction of the light water
                    reactors, leading to delays. Meanwhile, North Korea engaged in provocative acts
                    against South Korea and Japan, testing ballistic missiles and pursuing other
                    weapons activities. In 1998, suspected nuclear weapons activities at Kumchang-ri
                    brought the Agreed Framework to the brink of collapse. Once inspectors were
                    finally allowed in, they found no evidence of nuclear activity, but mistrust
                    remained high. The Clinton administration worked to get the Agreed Framework
                    back on track, leading to the visit of a North Korean envoy to the United
                    States, a joint statement of no hostile intent, and a reciprocal visit by
                    Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Pyongyang in October 2000.
However, despite these efforts, the nuclear issue was still unresolved. It was
                    not long before the next crisis would arise, requiring the international
                    community to take another approach to addressing the denuclearization issue.
                    North Korea broke out of the 1994 agreement in the winter of 2002, resulting in
                    the opening of the Six-Party Talks the following year, hosted by China.
