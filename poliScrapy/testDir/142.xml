Why is the Department called the Department of State?
On September 15, 1789, Congress passed An Act to provide for the safe
                            keeping of the Acts, Records, and Seal of the United States, and for
                            other purposes. This law changed the name of the Department of
                        Foreign Affairs to the Department of State because certain domestic duties
                        were assigned to the agency. These included:

Receipt, publication, distribution, and preservation of the laws of
                            the United States;
Preparation, sealing, and recording of the commissions of Presidential
                            appointees;
Preparation and authentication of copies of records and authentication
                            of copies under the Department's seal;
Custody of the Great Seal of the United States;
Custody of the records of the former Secretary of the Continental
                            Congress, except for those of the Treasury and War Departments.

Other domestic duties that the Department was responsible for at various
                        times included issuance of patents on inventions, publication of the census
                        returns, management of the mint, control of copyrights, and regulation of
                        immigration. Most domestic functions have been transferred to other
                        agencies. Those that remain in the Department are: storage and use of the
                        Great Seal, performance of protocol functions for the White House, drafting
                        of certain Presidential proclamations, and replies to public inquiries.
