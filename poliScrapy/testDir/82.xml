The Breakup of Yugoslavia, 1990&#8211;1992






Milestones: 1989&#8211;1992








The Breakup of Yugoslavia, 1990&#8211;1992
Issued on October 18, 1990, National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) 15&#8211;90 presented
                    a dire warning to the U.S. policy community:
Yugoslavia will cease to function as a federal state within a
                        year, and will probably dissolve within two. Economic reform will not stave
                        off the breakup. [...] A full-scale interrepublic war is unlikely, but
                        serious intercommunal conflict will accompany the breakup and will continue
                        afterward. The violence will be intractable and bitter. There is little the
                        United States and its European allies can do to preserve Yugoslav
                        unity.


1993 map of the former Yugoslavia. (Central Intelligence Agency)

The October 1990 judgment of the U.S. intelligence community, as Thomas Shreeve
                    noted in his 2003 study on NIE 15&#8211;90 for the National Defense University, &#8220;was
                    analytically sound, prescient, and well written. It was also fundamentally
                    inconsistent with what US policymakers wanted to happen in the former
                    Yugoslavia, and it had almost no impact on US policy.&#8221; By January 1992, the
                    Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ceased to exist, having dissolved into
                    its constituent states.
Yugoslavia&#8212;the land of South (i.e. Yugo) Slavs&#8212;was created at the end of World
                    War I when Croat, Slovenian, and Bosnian territories that had been part of the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire united with the Serbian Kingdom. The country broke up
                    under Nazi occupation during World War II with the creation of a Nazi-allied
                    independent Croat state, but was reunified at the end of the war when the
                    communist-dominated partisan force of Josip Broz Tito liberated the country.
                    Following the end of World War II, Yugoslavian unity was a top priority for the
                    U.S. Government. While ostensibly a communist state, Yugoslavia broke away from
                    the Soviet sphere of influence in 1948, became a founding member of the
                    Non-Aligned Movement in 1961, and adopted a more de-centralized and less
                    repressive form of government as compared with other East European communist
                    states during the Cold War.
The varied reasons for the country&#8217;s breakup ranged from the cultural and
                    religious divisions between the ethnic groups making up the nation, to the
                    memories of WWII atrocities committed by all sides, to centrifugal nationalist
                    forces. However, a series of major political events served as the catalyst for
                    exacerbating inherent tensions in the Yugoslav republic. Following the death of
                    Tito in 1980, provisions of the 1974 constitution provided for the effective
                    devolution of all real power away from the federal government to the republics
                    and autonomous provinces in Serbia by establishing a collective presidency of
                    the eight provincial representatives and a federal government with little
                    control over economic, cultural, and political policy. External factors also had
                    a significant impact. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, the
                    unification of Germany one year later, and the imminent collapse of the Soviet
                    Union all served to erode Yugoslavia&#8217;s political stability. As Eastern European
                    states moved away from communist government and toward free elections and market
                    economies, the West&#8217;s attention focused away from Yugoslavia and undermined the
                    extensive economic and financial support necessary to preserve a Yugoslav
                    economy already close to collapse. The absence of a Soviet threat to the
                    integrity and unity of Yugoslavia and its constituent parts meant that a
                    powerful incentive for unity and cooperation was removed.
Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia&#8217;s president from 1989, took advantage of the vacuum
                    created by a progressively weakening central state and brutally deployed the use
                    of Serbian ultra-nationalism to fan the flames of conflict in the other
                    republics and gain legitimacy at home. Milosevic started as a banker in Belgrade
                    and became involved in politics in the mid-1980s. He rose quickly through the
                    ranks to become head of the Serbian Communist Party in 1986. While attending a
                    party meeting in the Albanian-dominated province of Kosovo in May 1987, Serbians
                    in the province rioted outside the meeting hall. Milosevic spoke with the
                    rioters and listened to their complaints of mistreatment by the Albanian
                    majority. His actions were extensively reported by Serbian-controlled Yugoslav
                    mass media, beginning the process of transforming the former banker into the
                    stalwart symbol of Serbian nationalism. Having found a new source of legitimacy,
                    Milosevic quickly shored up his power in Serbia through control of the party
                    apparatus and the press. He moved to strip the two autonomous provinces of
                    Kosovo and Vojvodina of their constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy within Serbia
                    by using mass rallies to force the local leaderships to resign in favor of his
                    own preferred candidates. By mid-1989 Kosovo and Vojvodina had been reintegrated
                    into Serbia, and the Montenegro leadership was replaced by Milosevic allies.
The ongoing effects of democratization in Eastern Europe were felt throughout
                    Yugoslavia. As Milosevic worked to consolidate power in Serbia, elections in
                    Slovenia and Croatia in 1990 gave non-communist parties control of the state
                    legislatures and governments. Slovenia was the first to declare &#8220;sovereignty&#8221; in
                    1990, issuing a parliamentary declaration that Slovenian law took precedence
                    over Yugoslav law. Croatia followed in May, and in August, the Yugoslav republic
                    of Bosnia-Herzegovina also declared itself sovereign. Slovenia and Croatia began
                    a concerted effort to transform Yugoslavia from a federal state to a
                    confederation. With the administration of George H. W. Bush focused primarily on
                    the Soviet Union, Germany, and the crisis in the Persian Gulf, Yugoslavia had
                    lost the geostrategic importance it enjoyed during the Cold War. While
                    Washington attempted during the summer of 1990 to marshal some limited
                    coordination with its Western allies in case the Yugoslav crisis turned bloody,
                    Western European governments maintained a wait-and-see attitude. At the same
                    time, inter-republic relations in Yugoslavia spiraled out of control. Slovenia
                    overwhelmingly voted for independence in December 1990. A Croatian referendum in
                    May 1991 also supported full independence. Secretary of State James Baker
                    traveled to Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav leaders and urge a political solution
                    to no avail. Slovenia and Croatia both declared formal independence on June 25,
                    1991.
The Yugoslav Army (JNA) briefly intervened in Slovenia, but it withdrew after 10
                    days, effectively confirming Slovenia&#8217;s separation. The Serb minority in Croatia
                    declared its own independence from the republic and its desire to join Serbia,
                    sparking violence between armed militias. The JNA intervened in the conflict
                    ostensibly to separate the combatants, but it became quickly apparent that it
                    favored the Croatian-Serbs. The war that followed devastated Croatia, resulting
                    in tens of thousands dead, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In
                    Bosnia-Herzegovina, a referendum on independence took place in March 1992, but
                    was boycotted by the Serb minority. The republic declared its independence from
                    Yugoslavia in May 1992, while the Serbs in Bosnia declared their own areas an
                    independent republic. Macedonia itself also declared independence following a
                    September 1991 referendum, and a U.S. peacekeeping and monitoring force was
                    dispatched to the border with Serbia to monitor violence.
Croatia and Slovenia were internationally recognized in January 1992, with
                    Bosnia&#8217;s independence recognized soon thereafter. The three countries joined the
                    United Nations on May 22, 1992. Serbia and Montenegro formed a new Federal
                    Republic of Yugoslavia as a successor state to old Yugoslavia, but the
                    international community did not recognize its successor claim. Over the next
                    three years, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina claimed hundreds of thousands of
                    lives and displaced millions from their homes, as Europe witnessed the most
                    horrific fighting on its territory since the end of World War II. In 1998&#8211;1999,
                    violence erupted again in Kosovo, with the province&#8217;s majority Albanian
                    population calling for independence from Serbia. A NATO bombing campaign and
                    economic sanctions forced the Milosevic regime to accept a NATO-led
                    international peace keeping force. The province was placed under U.N.
                    administrative mandate. With the economy crumbling, Milosevic lost his grip on
                    power in 2001, was arrested, and turned over to the International Crimes
                    Tribunal in The Hague. He died in prison in 2006, before his trial concluded. In
                    2008, Kosovo declared independence and was recognized by the United States and
                    most European states, despite Russian objections.
