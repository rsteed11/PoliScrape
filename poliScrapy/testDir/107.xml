National Security Policy and SALT I, 1969-1972









&#8220;National Security Policy and SALT I, 1969-1972&#8221;
The Office of the Historian at the U.S. Department of State
                    and Williams College Present the Second Conference of the Foreign Relations of the United States Special Conference Series
&#8220;National Security Policy and SALT I, 1969-1972&#8221; March
                    2-3, 2012
The Office of the Historian at the U.S. Department of State and Williams College
                    are pleased to announce a conference marking the publication of the SALT I, 1969-1972 and the
                        National Security Policy,
                        1969-1972 volumes of the Foreign Relations of the
                        United States series. This conference marked the culmination of a
                    broader initiative to commemorate the 150th
                        anniversary of the Foreign Relations series and
                    was held at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts from March 2-3,
                    2012.
These two Foreign Relations volumes contain extensive
                    documentation of many important national security and foreign policy initiatives
                    that laid the foundation for U.S. foreign policy in the post-hegemonic era that
                    began in the 1970s. The SALT
                        I, 1969-1972 volume provides detailed records of arms control policy
                    formulation and implementation. The documentation illuminates both the
                    substantive issues involved in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks as well as
                    the negotiations&#8217; relationship to the broader context of linkage and d&#233;tente
                    that shaped high-level decision-making. The compilation includes transcripts of
                    taped White House meetings between high-level policymakers and documentation of
                    the Kissinger-Dobrynin back-channel in addition to records illustrating the
                    interagency process that defined U.S. policy and SALT delegation instructions.
                    The volume also contains coverage of White House efforts to secure Congressional
                    support for the final agreements.
The National Security Policy,
                        1969-1972 volume also covers several significant issues, including the
                    evolution of U.S. missile defense initiatives, efforts to adapt national
                    strategy to a new era of strategic parity with the Soviet Union and the growth
                    of a Chinese nuclear deterrent, the October 1969 Joint Chiefs of Staff Readiness
                    Test, the creation of an all-volunteer armed force, and the challenges of
                    balancing resources and commitments in an atmosphere of declining domestic
                    support for defense spending. Like the SALT I volume, the National Security
                    Policy volume incorporates a wide variety of U.S. Government records to
                    thoroughly document policy formulation at the highest levels.
To explore the major themes of these two volumes, we planned a conference
                    agenda with several complementary components. Paul Wolfowitz and Jeremi Suri
                    delivered opening and closing keynote addresses. One panel, moderated by
                    Edward Brynn of the Office of the Historian, included the volumes&#8217; compilers
                    and general editor discussing their experience preparing the volumes with
                    General Robert Pursley, who served as Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird&#8217;s
                    military advisor between 1969 and 1972. We also assembled three
                    interdisciplinary panels, comprised of historians and political scientists, to
                    assess the significance of the events documented in the two volumes as well as
                    the scholarly importance of the documents that they contain. The first of these
                    panels focused on deterrence in an era of parity, covering issues such as
                    nuclear strategy, arms control, missile defense, and intelligence capabilities.
                    A second panel examined problems of perceptions, including intelligence
                    collection and analytical capacities and the difficulties of signaling
                    intentions to allies and adversaries. The third panel covered evolving
                    constraints on U.S. policy, especially declining political, intellectual, and
                    budgetary support for maintaining Cold War capabilities and strategies.
