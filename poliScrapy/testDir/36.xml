Search Tips







Search Tips
By default, the search engine returns documents from the entire site* containing any of the
                    search terms you enter. All searches are case-insensitive, so searching for &#8220;SALT&#8221; will
                    return the same results as searching for &#8220;salt.&#8221; You can refine a query by (1) narrowing its
                    scope to specific sections of the website or to specific Foreign Relations volumes
                    and (2) using phrase, boolean, wildcard, and proximity operators in your search. Use the
                    following techniques and syntax to improve your search results. Click on each example to
                    pre-fill the search form with the parameters of your search, and then submit the search to
                    see the results.
* Note that the search engine&#8217;s results are limited to the materials that the Office of the
                    Historian has digitized. Please consult the full list of Foreign Relations volumes
                        by administration to see which volumes have been
                    digitized (indicated by the phrase, &#8220;full text,&#8221; next to each volume&#8217;s title), and consult
                    the University of Wisconsin Madison
                            FRUS collection or a library near you for access to volumes not yet
                    available here.

Scope
Beneath the keyword search field is a set of checkboxes. Selecting any of the checkboxes
                        can narrow the scope of your search, resulting in a faster, more specific query. The
                        default set of checkboxes contains the major content sections of the website: Historical
                        Documents, Department History, Milestones, Countries, Conferences, Educational
                        Resources, FRUS Sesquicentennial, and About (FAQ, Advisory Committee Minutes). You can
                        also select specific Foreign Relations volumes. To search for articles about
                        U.S. diplomatic history that relate to peace:
peace (with the &#8220;Department History&#8221; and &#8220;Milestones&#8221; checkboxes selected) 
If no checkboxes are selected, the entire site will be searched. To achieve the best
                        results, combine scope with the following search operators:


Phrases
When you type your search terms into the box, the search engine will search for those
                        terms, individually, anywhere in a document. To force the search engine to find fixed
                        phrases (i.e., specific, ordered combinations of words), place the phrase in quotation
                        marks. To locate documents which include both &#8220;peaceful&#8221; and &#8220;nuclear&#8221; anywhere in the
                        text, use the following search:
peaceful nuclear

To locate documents which use the phrase &#8220;peaceful nuclear,&#8221; use this search:
"peaceful nuclear"



Booleans
The search engine will allow you to perform Boolean searches (AND, OR, and NOT). Boolean
                        operators must be in all caps.
You can use Boolean operators with individual terms or with phrases enclosed in quotation
                        marks. For example, to locate documents which include both the word &#8220;Kissinger&#8221; and the
                        phrase &#8220;peaceful nuclear,&#8221; use this search:
Kissinger AND
                            "peaceful nuclear"

To locate documents which include either &#8220;Rhodesia&#8221; or &#8220;Zimbabwe,&#8221; use this search:
Rhodesia OR Zimbabwe

To locate documents which include the phrase &#8220;arms control&#8221; but exclude documents which
                        also include the term &#8220;SALT,&#8221; use this search:
"arms control" NOT SALT

You can also use the plus (+) and minus (-) signs to include or exclude certain terms. To
                        search for documents which must include the phrase &#8220;law of the sea&#8221; and may include the
                        term &#8220;seabed,&#8221; use this search:
+"law of the sea" seabed

To search for documents which include &#8220;Korea&#8221; but not &#8220;DMZ,&#8221; use this search:
Korea -DMZ

Finally, you can use parentheses to nest your searches. To find documents which include
                        &#8220;Guatemala&#8221; or &#8220;El Salvador&#8221; and &#8220;Belize,&#8221; use this search:
(Guatemala OR
                            "El Salvador") AND Belize



Wildcards
If you are unsure about the spelling of a term or want to find variants of a term, you
                        can use wildcards. The search engine supports two wildcard characters: ? and *.
If you want to replace a single letter in your search term, use ? in your query. To find
                        documents which include &#8220;text&#8221; or &#8220;test,&#8221; use this search:
te?t

Note that the above search will not return hits for &#8220;Tet&#8221; or &#8220;teapot.&#8221; If you want to
                        replace zero or more letters in your search term use * in your query. For example, to
                        find documents which include &#8220;Vietnam&#8221; and &#8220;Vietnamese,&#8221; use this search:
Vietna*

Note that the above search will not return hits for &#8220;Viet Nam,&#8221; another spelling of the
                        same country. You may have to try multiple variants of the same search to get all the
                        results you need.


Proximity
If you are searching for common words, you can tell the search engine to only return
                        documents in which the words are within a distance you define. To find documents which
                        include &#8220;Cuba&#8221; and &#8220;submarine&#8221; within 10 words of each other, use this search:
"Cuba submarine"~10

We are aware that &#8220;keyword in context&#8221; summary of the results of proximity searches are
                        not displaying correctly. The search results themselves, however, are reliable.
