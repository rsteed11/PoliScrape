Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and U.S.-Russian Relations






Milestones: 1993&#8211;2000








Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and U.S.-Russian Relations
Upon his inauguration in January 1993, President Bill
                        Clinton became the first president since Franklin Roosevelt who
                    did not need a strategy for the Cold War&#8212;and the first since William Howard Taft
                    who did not need a policy for the Soviet Union. In his inaugural address,
                    Clinton saluted the service of his predecessor, George H.W.
                        Bush, in the peaceful resolution of the conflict between the
                    superpowers. He also acknowledged that, even without the Soviet Union, the world
                    was still threatened by &#8220;ancient hatreds and new plagues.&#8221; Planning to focus on
                    domestic affairs, Clinton intended to leave the day-to-day management of foreign
                    policy&#8212;including dealing with the &#8220;ancient hatreds and new plagues&#8221; of the
                    former Soviet sphere of influence&#8212;to senior members of his national security
                    team. He also recruited Strobe Talbott, a journalist and
                    Russian expert, to assume a portfolio for the region, first as
                    Ambassador-at-Large and then, from February 1994, as Deputy Secretary of State.
                    By appointing Talbott, a close friend since both had served as Rhodes scholars
                    in the late 1960s, Clinton wanted to demonstrate his personal commitment to
                    Russia in the emerging post-Cold War world. Such calculations were soon
                    overtaken by events, however, as the challenges of managing relations between
                    two former adversaries proved too much for his subordinates to handle on their
                    own. &#8220;By the spring of his first year in office,&#8221; Talbott later recalled,
                    &#8220;Clinton had become the U.S. government&#8217;s principal Russia hand, and so he
                    remained for the duration of his presidency.&#8221;

Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton, October 23, 1995, during the summit
                        meeting at Hyde Park, New York. (William J. Clinton Presidential
                        Library)

Like many of his predecessors, Bill Clinton tended to view relations with other
                    countries through the prism of personality. In this case, Russia was personified
                    by its President, Boris Yeltsin. Clinton was strongly
                    inclined not only to like Yeltsin but also to support his policies, in
                    particular, his commitment to Russian democracy. During the seven years both
                    were in office, &#8220;Bill and Boris&#8221; met eighteen times, nearly as often as their
                    predecessors had met throughout the entire Cold War. For his first trip abroad,
                    Clinton met Yeltsin in Vancouver in April 1993. At the time, and periodically
                    throughout his term in office, Yeltsin faced growing opposition at home to his
                    efforts to liberalize the economy and enact democratic reforms in Russia. At
                    Vancouver, Clinton promised Yeltsin strong support in the form of financial
                    assistance to promote various programs, including funds to stabilize the
                    economy, to house decommissioned military officers, and to employ nuclear
                    scientists. The U.S. Congress&#8212;including broad, bipartisan majority in the
                    Senate&#8212;approved the program in September. Although not always able to deliver
                    such assistance, Clinton also supported Yeltsin and his position on economic and
                    political matters by other means. At Clinton&#8217;s behest, and at a meeting he
                    hosted in Denver in June 1997, for instance, Russia became a member of the
                    so-called G&#8211;8, the group of leaders representing eight of the world&#8217;s leading
                    economies, thus ensuring that Russian interests would be considered at this
                    important annual forum.
Clinton and Yeltsin also continued the bilateral cooperation, begun by Ronald
                    Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, to manage the most tangible, and terrifying,
                    relics of the Cold War. The control of nuclear weapons had always been one of
                    the most difficult issues for the two superpowers to negotiate. The task in the
                    1990s, however, was greatly complicated by the fact that Russia did not maintain
                    control over the entire Soviet inventory; some strategic (long-range) and
                    theater (intermediate range) nuclear weapons were also still based on the
                    territory of at least Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. In terms of
                    international law, and as a matter of foreign policy, the United States urged
                    the four former Soviet republics to assume Soviet obligations under three arms
                    control agreements: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, the
                    Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) of 1987, and the Strategic Arms
                    Reduction Talks Treaty of 1991 (START I). Under the Lisbon Protocol of May 1992,
                    Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan agreed not only to abide by the NPT and
                    START I, but also to destroy or transfer to Russia all remaining nuclear weapons
                    at their disposal. The Clinton administration soon discovered, however, that
                    political concerns in Kiev and Almaty&#8212;in particular, fears of political
                    interference from Moscow&#8212;impeded further progress not only in negotiating
                    additional but also in implementing existing agreements. Clinton and Yeltsin
                    managed to address such concerns through a combination of security assurances
                    and economic assistance. In November 1994, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and
                    Kazakhstan finally agreed to adhere to INF; then, the following month, the four
                    countries formally ratified START I. After nearly two years of negotiations, the
                    United States thus succeeded in transferring Soviet treaty obligations to reduce
                    or eliminate nuclear weapons to post-Soviet successor states, who, in turn,
                    agreed to transfer the weapons to Russia. Under the Cooperative Threat Reduction
                    program, established by the Nunn-Lugar Act of 1991, the United States&#8212;in an
                    unprecedented partnership with the four countries&#8212;also became directly involved
                    in the &#8220;dirty work&#8221; of fulfilling these commitments, providing financial
                    assistance and technical expertise in securing and dismantling the Soviet
                    nuclear arsenal.
Throughout the Clinton administration, U.S.-Russian relations were embroiled over
                    how to address the challenges of European security. During the Cold War, the two
                    sides organized on opposite sides of the Iron Curtain: in 1949, the United
                    States and its Western European allies established the North Atlantic Treaty
                    Organization (NATO); and in 1955, the Soviet Union and its Eastern European
                    allies established the Warsaw Treaty Organization. When the Warsaw Pact formally
                    disbanded in February 1991, NATO began to debate in earnest how to adapt the
                    alliance to the realities of post-Cold War Europe, including a proposal to
                    expand membership to include countries in the former Soviet sphere of influence.
                    The debate became more urgent with the outbreak of war in the former Yugoslavia,
                    in particular, Bosnia-Herzegovina in April 1992. In an effort to address
                    concerns in Warsaw, Prague, and other capitals&#8212;without at the same time unduly
                    raising concerns in Moscow&#8212;NATO formally agreed in January 1994 to establish the
                    Partnership for Peace, which in effect created a pathway toward membership for
                    nations joining the organization, without extending the security commitment of
                    the alliance. Russia joined the Partnership in June 1994. Despite this agreement
                    on paper, events on the ground increasingly threatened to undermine bilateral
                    relations. Clinton objected to Russian military intervention in the autonomous
                    region of Chechnya, including the siege of Grozny, which began in January 1995;
                    and Yeltsin objected to U.S. military intervention in Bosnia, including NATO
                    airstrikes in September. The Dayton Agreement, which ended the Bosnian War in
                    December, and the Khasavyurt Accord, which ended the First Chechen War in August
                    1996, did not resolve growing tensions between the two countries. At its meeting
                    in Madrid, July 1997, NATO formally invited three former Soviet
                    satellites&#8212;Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic&#8212;to join the alliance; and in
                    March 1999, less than two weeks after their membership became effective, NATO
                    began to bomb Serbia, Russia&#8217;s ally, in an effort to end its military operations
                    in Kosovo. Yeltsin denounced but could not deflect either development. Likewise,
                    Clinton could do little but protest five months later as Russia began a massive
                    bombing campaign in the Second Chechen War. When Yeltsin suddenly resigned from
                    office in December, however, Clinton praised his counterpart for helping to
                    achieve &#8220;genuine progress&#8221; in U.S.-Russian relations. &#8220;Of course, we have also
                    had our differences,&#8221; Clinton observed, &#8220;but the starting point for our
                    relationship has always been how Russia and America can work together to advance
                    our common interests.&#8221;
