Open Government Initiative







Open Government Initiative
Transparency, participation, and collaboration are the foundation of open government. In
                        keeping with this principle established in the President&#8217;s December 2009 Open
                            Government Directive, the Office of the Historian has adapted its publications to
                        open digital formats that can be accessed and consumed easily by the public, including third
                        party developers. In 2010, the Office of the Historian made the following submissions to
                        data.gov, which remain up to date: 
Bibliographic Metadata of the Foreign Relations of
                                        the United States Series: Raw bibliographic metadata for the nearly
                                500 volumes in the Foreign Relations of the
                                        United States series published since 1861. Each record in the
                                dataset contains a volume&#8217;s title, year of publication, years covered by the volume,
                                summary, and links to sources for these volumes online or in print, among other
                                metadata items. [Data.gov catalog entry]
Latest Volumes of Foreign Relations of the United
                                        States Series: This atom feed lists the ten most recently published
                                volumes in the Foreign Relations of the United
                                    States series. Each record in the dataset contains a volume&#8217;s title, year of
                                publication, summary, and link to the online volumes. The feed is updated as soon as
                                a new volume is published. [Data.gov catalog entry]

Building on this foundation and extending the focus beyond data, the President&#8217;s May 2012 Digital Government Strategy emphasized delivering better digital services to the
                        American people government through mobile devices and providing automated services for third
                        party web and app developers. In 2013, the Office of the Historian made the following
                        contributions to the Digital Government Strategy: 
Ebook Editions of Office of the Historian
                                Publications: The Foreign Relations of the United States
                                (FRUS) series, established in 1861, was adapted to ebook. Far lighter
                                and more portable than printed editions of FRUS, the ebook edition offers
                                the full content of each volume and makes use of the full-text search and other
                                reading features of most ebook devices and applications, including bookmarking and
                                note-taking. Unlike the web-based edition of FRUS, the ebook edition, once
                                downloaded, can be accessed even without internet connectivity. The ebooks were
                                generated from the master digital files at no additional cost and are available for
                                free download.
Office of the Historian Ebook Catalog API: This Application Programming Interface
                                (API) enables third party web and app developers, as well as users of these
                                applications, to embed the Office of the Historian ebook catalog. The API uses best
                                practices and open standards, including the
                                Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) format for ebook catalogs and REST interfaces.
