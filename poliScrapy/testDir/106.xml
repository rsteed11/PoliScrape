Foreign Economic Policy, 1973-1976









&#8220;Foreign Economic Policy, 1973-1976&#8221;
The Office of the Historian, U.S. Department of State, and
                     The George Mason University School of Public Policy Present the
                    Inaugural Conference of theForeign Relations of the United States Special Conference
                    Series
&#8220;Foreign Economic Policy, 1973-1976&#8221; March 7, 2011
As part of an array of events designed to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the Foreign Relations of the United
                            States (FRUS) series, the State Department&#8217;s Office of the
                    Historian is inaugurating the FRUS Special Conference Series to highlight
                    recently-published FRUS volumes.
On March 7th, the Office of the Historian and the George Mason University School
                    of Public Policy will host a half-day conference focused on the FRUS volume
                    dealing with Foreign Economic Policy, 1973-1976 . The
                    conference will take place at the George Mason University School of Public
                    Policy in Arlington, Virginia. The text of Foreign Economic
                        Policy, 1973-1976 is available online, allowing
                    conference attendees to read it beforehand.
Foreign Economic Policy, 1973-1976 examines U.S. policy
                    during a time of great global economic change, focusing on issues such as the
                    end of the fixed exchange rate system envisioned at the 1944 Bretton Woods
                    conference and the transition to flexible exchange rates; the creation of the
                    G-7 economic summit; the passage of the Trade Act of 1974; the launch of the
                    Tokyo Round of GATT negotiations; and North/South relations and commodity policy
                    in a post-1973 oil embargo world. The significance of the volume and the lessons
                    to be gleaned from this period by historians, economists, and policy analysts
                    promise an engaging event.
The conference will feature a presentation by the volume&#8217;s editor, Dr. Kathleen
                    Rasmussen; an academic panel of historians, foreign policy analysts, and
                    economists; and a keynote address by Under Secretary of State for Economic,
                    Energy, and Agricultural Affairs Robert Hormats (who is also the author of
                    several key documents in the Foreign Economic Policy,
                        1973-1976 volume). Participants on the academic panel include: Will
                    Gray, Department of History, Purdue University; Susan Aaronson, Elliot School of
                    International Affairs, George Washington University; Dan Hamilton, School of
