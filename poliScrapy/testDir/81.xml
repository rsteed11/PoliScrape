Tiananmen Square, 1989






Milestones: 1989&#8211;1992








Tiananmen Square, 1989
The establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the United States and
                    the People&#8217;s Republic of China in 1979, together with Chinese Vice Premier Deng
                    Xiaoping&#8217;s economic reforms, inaugurated a decade of vibrant cultural exchange
                    and expanding economic ties between the two countries. However, the Chinese
                    Government&#8217;s violent suppression of demonstrations in Tiananmen Square on June
                    4, 1989, cooled U.S.-Chinese relations considerably. To the present day, the
                    Department of State marks the anniversary of the suppression by issuing a
                    statement calling on the Chinese Government to end harassment of those who
                    participated in the protests and to fully account for those killed, detained, or
                    missing.

The demonstrations began on April 15, when Chinese students gathered in Beijing&#8217;s
                    Tiananmen Square, where so many student and mass demonstrations had taken place
                    since the early 20th century, to mark the death of the popular pro-reform
                    Chinese leader Hu Yaobang. The demonstration became a forum to protest
                    corruption and inflation, and call for broader political and economic reforms to
                    build on the reforms that had already transformed China considerably in the
                    post-Mao era. 
The Chinese leadership was divided on how to handle the demonstrations. As the
                    numbers of protesters swelled to the tens of thousands, some leaders who saw the
                    protests as a direct challenge to Communist Party rule labeled the demonstrators
                    &#8220;counter-revolutionary&#8221; in an April 26 editorial in the government-run People&#8217;s Daily newspaper. Other officials sympathetic to
                    the protestors&#8217; demands for political reform favored a conciliatory approach, as
                    represented by General Secretary of the Communist Party Zhao Ziyang&#8217;s visit with
                    protestors on May 4 to hear and acknowledge their concerns.
Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev&#8217;s impending state visit on May 15
                    invigorated the protests. Some protestors initiated hunger strikes to increase
                    pressure on the government. Foreign media that arrived to cover the visit turned
                    their attention to the protests and heightened international&#8212;especially
                    Western&#8212;awareness of the protesters and their demands. The crowds in the Square
                    grew beyond students to include a broad segment of Chinese society, from workers
                    to ordinary citizens from Beijing and beyond, and reportedly exceeded one
                    million in number. Gorbachev&#8217;s visit occupied Chinese officials&#8217; attention until
                    his departure on May 18. On May 19, Zhao visited the protesters once more to
                    make an emotional appeal for hunger strikes to end. The Chinese leadership
                    imposed martial law in Beijing on May 20. The protests continued.
On the night of June 3 and 4, the People&#8217;s Liberation Army stormed the Square
                    with tanks, crushing the protests with terrible human costs. Estimates of the
                    numbers killed vary. The Chinese Government has asserted that injuries exceeded
                    3,000 and that over 200 individuals, including 36 university students, were
                    killed that night. Western sources, however, are skeptical of the official
                    Chinese report and most frequently cite the toll as hundreds or even thousands
                    killed. Similar protests that had taken place in other Chinese cities were soon
                    suppressed and their leaders imprisoned.
In the aftermath, President George H.W. Bush denounced the actions in Tiananmen
                    Square and suspended military sales as well as high level exchanges with Chinese
                    officials. Many members of the U.S. Congress, the American public, and
                    international leaders advocated broader economic sanctions, some of which were
                    implemented. U.S. leaders met with Chinese nationals studying in the United
                    States as a symbolic gesture of commitment. Questions of relations with China,
                    in particular the granting of Most-Favored-Nation trading status, were
                    controversial questions for the remainder of President Bush&#8217;s term and into the
                    term of President Bill Clinton.
