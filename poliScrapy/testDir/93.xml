Milestones: 1989&#8211;1992








1989&#8211;1992: The Presidency of George H.W.
                    Bush
The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a massive
                    shift in the international balance of power and left the United States as the
                    sole remaining superpower.

                        Oval Office of the White House. (George Bush Presidential Library and
                        Museum)

President George H.W. Bush took the oath of office with foreign policy on his
                    mind. He brought to the White House strong credentials: Congressman, Ambassador
                    to the United Nations, Permanent Representative to the People&#8217;s Republic of
                    China, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Vice President of the
                    United States. He started his career in military service in 1942, enlisting in
                    the Navy on his 18th birthday and earning a commission as an ensign several days
                    before his 19th birthday. He later served as a torpedo bomber pilot, earning a
                    Distinguished Flying Cross; he was the last veteran of World War II to serve as
                    president.
Patrician and self-effacing, President Bush engaged foreign dignitaries with
                    ease. He already knew most world leaders on a first-name basis. Former President
                    Ronald Reagan&#8217;s physical grace and soaring rhetoric led to unkind comparisons in
                    the lead-up to the 1988 campaign. The October 19, 1987, edition of Newsweek featured Bush on the cover with the caption:
                    &#8220;Fighting the &#8216;Wimp Factor.&#8217;&#8221; Whether from this portrayal of him or merely his
                    highly competitive instincts, Bush overwhelmed his opponents in Republican
                    primary debates and ran a highly aggressive general election campaign against
                    Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. While a majority of Americans voted for
                    him, Bush was a Burkean conservative in a burgeoning Information Age, and he did
                    not always connect with the average man on the street.
Democrats who comprised a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and the
                    U.S. Senate bore lingering resentment from the 1988 campaign, while
                    conservatives such as House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich recalled Bush&#8217;s track
                    record as a political moderate. There were few coattails to President Bush&#8217;s
                    electoral triumph, in other words, and neither a &#8220;Bush Revolution&#8221; in 1988 nor a
                    class of &#8220;Bush Democrats&#8221; in the 101st Congress. In contrast, the so-called
                    foreign policy establishment held him in high regard. Former Assistant to the
                    President for National Security Affairs Zbigniew Brzezinski endorsed him for
                    president&#8212;even though Brzezinski had mentored most of Bush&#8217;s opponent&#8217;s foreign
                    policy advisers.
President Bush faced additional constraints. The massive tax cuts he himself had
                    termed &#8220;voodoo economics&#8221; in the 1980 Republican primary had stimulated the U.S.
                    economy but failed to increase tax revenues, while the 1985 Gramm-Rudman Deficit
                    Reduction Act triggered automatic spending cuts. Concern over the national debt
                    was the chief substantive issue of the 1988 campaign, and Bush had vowed to
                    reduce it without raising taxes. Inflation was tame and unemployment relatively
                    low, yet the transition to a post-industrial economy and the influx of
                    high-technology consumer products from Japan raised the specter of a decline in
                    America&#8217;s economic and technological leadership. The shock of the October 1987
                    stock market crash persisted, coming as it did in a year of two bestsellers,
                    Paul Kennedy&#8217;s The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers and
                    Allan Bloom&#8217;s Closing of the American Mind, which
                    predicted a gloomy future for the West.
Bush rejected such pessimism, as it contrasted with developments in the
                    international political system. Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev&#8217;s
                    comprehensive reforms spoke to mankind&#8217;s universal yearning to live in an open
                    society. Chinese Chairman Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s economic reforms demonstrated the
                    intellectual bankruptcy of communism. The ascent of democratic governments in
                    the Philippines and Chile indicated that right-wing authoritarian regimes&#8212;as
                    opposed to left-wing totalitarian ones&#8212;could in fact evolve into democracies.
                    And the stirrings of liberty in Poland and Hungary offered tremendous
                    opportunity to pierce the Iron Curtain.
Bush appointed as Secretary of State his best friend, James A. Baker, who in turn
                    chose career foreign service officer Lawrence Eagleburger as his deputy. Another
                    close associate, Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft, became Assistant to the
                    President for National Security Affairs, a position he had held in the
                    administration of President Gerald Ford. Scowcroft chose as his deputy Robert
                    Gates, a career employee of the Central Intelligence Agency who had served on
                    the National Security Council (NSC) under both Scowcroft and Brzezinski. Yet
                    another veteran of the Ford administration, Congressman Richard Cheney, became
                    Secretary of Defense after the Tower nomination debacle. With the addition of
                    General Colin Powell, Reagan&#8217;s last national security adviser who became
                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1989, these individuals formed
                    the core of the Bush foreign policy team and would all serve in some capacity
                    for the entirety of the administration. They, in turn, assembled a roster of
                    staffers who prided themselves on working in relative harmony with
                    interdepartmental counterparts. These included Robert Blackwill, Condoleezza
                    Rice, Philip Zelikow, Robert Hutchings, and Richard Haass at the NSC; Robert
                    Zoellick, Dennis Ross, Robert Kimmett, and William Burns at the Department of
                    State; and Paul Wolfowitz at the Department of Defense.
Presiding over this operation, Bush valued teamwork and loyalty. He extolled
                    prudence and pragmatism, and did not entertain romantic visions such as a shield
                    that could make nuclear weapons obsolete. Over time, he and his administration
                    would strive to build what he termed in his September 11, 1991, address before a
                    joint session of congress on the Persian Gulf Crisis and federal budget deficit,
                    a &#8220;new world order,&#8221; one &#8220;freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the
                    pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace.&#8221;
