75. Telegram From the Embassy in Korea to
                            the Department of State1

Seoul, November 3, 1970, 0942Z.
5782. From Ambassador. Subj: Korean Presidential Campaign.
1. Since ROK Assemblyman Kim Dae Jung won the nomination of the
                            New Democratic Party (NDP) for the
                            Presidency, he has been campaigning in manner that is causing
                            considerable uneasiness among Democratic Republican Party (DRP), including latter&#8217;s leader, President Park.
2. Kim is attracting very large crowds in major
                            cities, before whom he unhesitatingly discusses number of sensitive
                            issues, domestic and foreign. He is forceful orator, and reports
                            indicate that he can both effectively harangue crowds and deal
                            persuasively with intellectual groups. He is challenging Park by name and issue.
3. He has brought about major outcry in govt circles by advocating elimination of Homeland Reserve
                            (HR). While he did not mention fact specifically, he is of course aware
                            that popular enthusiasm toward service in that body has waned due to
                            favoritism on wide scale which enables sons of officials and others who
                            are well connected to avoid reporting for drill sessions, which,
                            moreover, are considered tedious by men who were drilling in same manner
                            as recruits ten years ago. In coastal areas units put in more than twice
                            as many duty hours as city dwellers, and their dislike for such duty is
                            increased by fact their absence from area and fishing boat frequently
                            brings economic loss for which they are not compensated.
4. Mr. Kim is doing his best also to get govt over barrel on local self-government
                            issue, and he is reviving memories of fact that local elections were
                            once promised by President Park
                            and his party. DRP is in quandary as to
                            how to handle that one because local elections would remove rigid
                            control which party now exercises through system of appointive
                            governors, mayors, county and district chiefs. System has proven hightly
                            effective in both rewarding and punishing rural communities on basis
                            their election performances.
5. Kim&#8217;s basic theme is simple. He does not deny
                                Park&#8217;s achievements, but he
                            declares that change is needed to straighten out political, economic and
                            social inequities which he claims are developing in Korea. In addition
                            to issues cited above, he has declared himself in favor of lowering
                            voting age, raising investment in rural areas by twenty [Page 191]per cent, a graduated
                            income-tax scale, for enhancement of women&#8217;s status through committee
                            which would be under direct control of President, support for needy
                            students and for eliminating that great bugaboo of Korean families, the
                            college entrance examinations.
6. DRP has moved to curb
                                Kim&#8217;s electioneering by having Central Election
                            Management Committee, which it controls, declare that campaigning for
                            presidency must be limited to period of forty days prior to actual
                            election. During meeting with me last week at Kim&#8217;s
                            request (memo pouched) I questioned him about effect of CEMC&#8217;s ruling.
                            He said that he would ignore it, and he has done so up to now. DRP at this point is baffled, because CEMC
                            ruling does not affect right of political parties to hold rallies.
                            Persons are not supposed to proclaim their candidacy for presidency, but
                            even if Kim observed that rule, no one can possibly
                            misunderstand his words, his purpose, and his demeanor.
7. After my meeting with Kim, Prime Minister brought
                            it up in conversation and asked my impressions of nominee. I said I
                            found Kim interesting person who spoke in measured
                            terms and who seemed to be clear-minded as well as determined. I added
                            that I thought it would be interesting election. He inquired whether in
                            my opinion there would be problem for President Park. I said I did not care to make judgment
                            on that matter. PriMin then said that
                            Mr. Kim was putting out reports to effect I
                            supporting him and that I would help him go to United States. I
                            commented there were two things about such reports, first being that
                            they were without foundation, and secondly that I had heard them from
                            several sources all of which, interestingly enough, were connected with
                                DRP.
8. Minister of Defense then approached me and brought up subject of
                            opposition candidate&#8217;s desire to eliminate Homeland Reserve, which
                            Minister said must be maintained at all costs. I said that our opinion
                            of value of Reserve had not changed, thought there were many things
                            about way it was being developed which were having effect on public.
                            Minister then said we would soon see what govt would do to equalize service for all elements of
                            Reserve. I said I had no comment to make on that as it is Mr.
                                Kim and not I who had been bothering him on
                            subject.
9. President is said to have had some highly charged moments as he read
                                Kim&#8217;s speeches. Opening para of that part of
                                Kim&#8217;s speech to Seoul Corespondents Club on
                            October 30 on &#8220;Korean Diplomacy in the 1970&#8217;s&#8221; reportedly had
                            particularly pronounced effect on Park. At that point the NDP nominee said he believed talks with Kim Il Sung should be preceded by
                            latter&#8217;s denunciation of aggression. Kim Dae
                                Jung then continued: &#8220;At the same time, I am firmly
                            opposed to creating this atmosphere of tension and horror, as evidenced
                            in the policy of [Page 192]the present
                            administration of President Park Chung
                                Hee to prolong the life of one&#8217;s regime in the name of
                            national security and anti-communism.&#8221; It is reliably reported that
                                Park had to be peeled off the
                            ceiling after that one. President has made no campaign move as yet. He
                            is not noted for charisma, and would in any case be inhibited by his
                            sense of personal dignity and local custom from engaging in direct
                            debate with his opponent.
10. Kim is receiving strong support from his two
                            erstwhile rivals for NDP nomination, Kim
                            Young Sam and Lee Chul Sung, who are stumping with him. They are
                            articulate trio, quite possibly better than anything majority party can
                            field. Among many other things DRP is
                            also annoyed because Kim Dae
                            Jung&#8217;s given name &#8220;Dae
                                Jung&#8221; literally means &#8220;large crowds&#8221; or &#8220;masses,&#8221; and
                                DRP leaders are complaining that he
                            uses his name much too frequently as he tells crowds that &#8220;day of masses
                            has arrived.&#8221;
11. We will be exercising care as we observe developments to insure that
                            neither side uses us for its purposes. It is obvious already that we are
                            witnessing interesting developments which are likely to become even more
                            so if Kim contines to draw crowds. (At Kwangju
                            yesterday two hundred thousand persons came to hear him, and at Pusan
                            several days ago he reportedly had from seventy-five to one hundred
                            thousand.) DRP strategists are in some
                            disarray, and their reported plan to stand on Park&#8217;s record may have to be greatly
                            altered to deal with Kim&#8217;s promises, as Korean
                            public generally is not overly enthralled by accounts of what party did
                            for them yesterday.
12. We have en route to Dept comprehensive review of these developments
                            and plan to continue frequent and complete coverage.2

In telegram 5804 from Seoul, November 4, Porter reported on the Korean
                                Government and DRP reaction to
                                nominee Kim Dae Jung and that
                                    Park asked the Prime
                                Minister &#8220;to do something&#8221; about Kim.
