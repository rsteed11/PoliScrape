The August 17, 1982 U.S.-China Communiqu&#233; on Arms Sales to Taiwan






Milestones: 1981&#8211;1988








The August 17, 1982 U.S.-China Communiqu&#233; on Arms Sales to Taiwan
On August 17, 1982, after eight months of contentious negotiations, the United
                    States and the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) issued the United States-China
                    Joint Communiqu&#233; on United States Arms Sales to Taiwan, more commonly known as
                    the August 17 Communiqu&#233;. The Communiqu&#233; addressed the troublesome issue of U.S.
                    arms sales to Taiwan in an effort to prevent the collapse of U.S.&#8211;PRC
                    relations.

President and Nancy Reagan at the Great Wall of China, April 1984. (Ronald
                        Reagan Presidential Library)

The administration of President Jimmy Carter formally normalized relations with
                    the People&#8217;s Republic of China on January 1, 1979, but the perpetually divisive
                    issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan remained unresolved. On the one hand,
                    officials in the Carter administration and the incoming administration of
                    President Ronald Reagan, along with majorities in Congress, agreed that the
                    United States should not end arms sales to Taiwan. On the other hand, PRC
                    officials insisted that the continuation of such sales was a violation of their
                    country&#8217;s sovereignty and justification for downgrading relations with the
                    United States. Making matters more contentious, the Taiwan Relations Act of
                    April 1979 required the United States to continue to sell defensive arms to
                    Taiwan; PRC officials saw the law as a direct challenge to the normalization
                    agreement finalized a few months earlier. U.S. and PRC officials both recognized
                    that if the two sides could not establish a modus vivendi
                    on the future of U.S. arms sales, U.S.&#8211;PRC relations could retrogress or
                    collapse entirely.
In January 1982, the United States and the People&#8217;s Republic of China commenced
                    official discussions on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. As the two sides began
                    exchanging drafts of a potential communiqu&#233;, two major disagreements were
                    immediately apparent. The first area of discord was the nature of future U.S.
                    arms sales to Taiwan. The People&#8217;s Republic of China insisted that the United
                    States eventually, and relatively quickly, end all arms sales. While the Reagan
                    administration was prepared to place qualitative and quantitative limits on its
                    future arms sales, and gradually to reduce those sales over time, it was
                    unwilling to commit itself to the termination of such transactions. The second
                    dispute centered on the nature of PRC policy toward Taiwan. The Reagan
                    administration stated that arms sales reductions were contingent on a PRC policy
                    of maintaining peaceful relations with Taiwan. PRC officials, however, refused
                    to make any official commitments to the United States on their future policy
                    toward Taiwan, arguing that doing so would be a challenge to their country&#8217;s
                    sovereignty.
In May 1982, with negotiations largely stalled due to these significant
                    disagreements, Reagan suggested that Vice President George H.W. Bush travel to
                    Beijing to meet with high-level officials. Bush was not traveling to China to
                    engage in detailed communiqu&#233; negotiations, but U.S. officials hoped that his
                    visit would, nonetheless, jumpstart the languishing talks and convince PRC
                    officials that the United States was committed to reaching an agreement. Bush
                    met with several high-level Chinese officials, including the leader of the
                    People&#8217;s Republic of China, Deng Xiaoping, and discussed a wide range of issues
                    affecting U.S.&#8211;PRC relations. In addition, during Bush&#8217;s trip the White House
                    publicized three letters from President Reagan&#8212;to Deng, Premier Zhao Ziyang, and
                    Communist Party Chairman Hu Yaobang&#8212;that stressed the importance of U.S.&#8211;PRC
                    relations, recognized the significance of the People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8217;s
                    peaceful approach to the Taiwan issue, and reinforced Reagan&#8217;s willingness to
                    reduce U.S. arms sales to Taiwan if the People&#8217;s Republic of China maintained
                    its peaceful policy. The visit marked a turning point in the communiqu&#233;
                    negotiations, largely because it confirmed the personal involvement of both Deng
                    and Reagan in the ongoing talks. Both leaders, it was clear, wanted and
                    anticipated a speedy and successful conclusion to the communiqu&#233;
                    negotiations.
By the end of July, after several weeks of intense internal discussions in both
                    Washington and Beijing, U.S. and PRC officials had worked out many of the
                    communiqu&#233;&#8217;s most vexing problems. Chinese officials dropped their insistence
                    that the United States agree to a &#8220;date certain&#8221; for the termination of all arms
                    sales to Taiwan and the two sides found agreeable language that combined the
                    People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8217;s commitment to maintaining peaceful relations toward
                    Taiwan with the United States&#8217; respect for China&#8217;s sovereignty.
On August 17, 1982, the People&#8217;s Republic of China and United States announced
                    the agreement of the Communiqu&#233;. Agreement on the Communiqu&#233; did not, however,
                    signal consensus between the United States and the People&#8217;s Republic of China on
                    the issue of arms sales to Taiwan. In describing it, U.S. and PRC officials
                    purposefully highlighted different aspects of the Communiqu&#233; and offered
                    significantly different interpretations of the language. U.S. officials, for
                    example, focused on the correlation between reduction of arms sales to Taiwan
                    and the People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8217;s peaceful policy toward Taiwan. PRC
                    officials chose instead to focus on the U.S. pledges to respect PRC sovereignty
                    and gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan. The malleability of the Communiqu&#233;
                    was intentional and, in fact, allowed it to be successful. Though the Communiqu&#233;
                    did not put an end to differences over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, U.S. and PRC
                    officials were able to embrace it as it provided each nation a reasonable
                    platform from which to pursue its own policy while simultaneously challenging
                    that of the other side. This understanding, however tenuous, allowed the United
                    States and the People&#8217;s Republic of China to move beyond the divisive and
                    restrictive issue of arms sales to Taiwan and take up other bilateral
                    issues.
