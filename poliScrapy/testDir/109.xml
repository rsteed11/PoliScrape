The Historian
Dr. Stephen Randolph serves as The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.
                        Appointed to that position in April 2012, Dr. Randolph is responsible for the
                            Foreign Relations of the United States series, which
                        has documented American foreign relations since its inception in 1861. The
                        Office of the Historian is further responsible for documenting the history of
                        the Department of State, for providing historical analysis and support to policy
                        makers throughout the Department of State, and for history-based outreach to the
                        educational community and the American public.
Prior to his arrival in the Department of State, Dr. Randolph served on the
                        faculty at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, National Defense
                        University, from 1997-2011. While there he served as department chairman for the
                        Department of Grand Strategy and Mobilization, and later for the Department of
                        Military Strategy and Logistics. He then served as the Associate Dean of Faculty
                        responsible for curriculum planning, accreditation, and strategic planning until
                        moving to the Department of State in 2011.
Dr. Randolph graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1974, and
                        served twenty-seven years on active duty in the Air Force, retiring as a colonel
                        in 2001. While on active duty he flew F-4s and F-15s, with a tour in Operation
                        Desert Storm, and served in senior staff positions on the Joint Staff and the
                        Air Staff. He earned a master&#8217;s degree in the History of Science from the Johns
                        Hopkins University in 1975, and a Doctorate in History from the George
                        Washington University in 2005. Dr. Randolph is the author of Powerful and
                            Brutal Weapons: Nixon, Kissinger, and the Easter Offensive,
                        published by Harvard University Press in 2007.
