The Gulf War, 1991






Milestones: 1989&#8211;1992








The Gulf War, 1991
At the end of the Iran-Iraq War of 1980&#8211;1988, Iraq emerged with its state intact
                    and a reinforced sense of national pride, but laden with massive debts. Iraq had
                    largely financed the war effort through loans, and owed some $37 billion to Gulf
                    creditors in 1990. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called on the United Arab
                    Emirates and Kuwait to cancel the Iraqi debt they held, arguing that the loans
                    should be considered payments to Iraq for protecting the Arabian Peninsula from
                    Iranian expansionism, but his appeals went unanswered. The Gulf states&#8217; refusal
                    to cancel Iraq&#8217;s war debts contributed to Saddam Hussein&#8217;s decision to make
                    threats against Iraq&#8217;s rich, but militarily weak, neighbor Kuwait.

                        Thanksgiving holiday visit during Operation Desert Storm. (Department of
                        Defense/Gerald Johnson)

After Kuwait rejected Saddam&#8217;s debt-forgiveness demands, he threatened to
                    reignite a conflict over the long-standing question of ownership of the Warbah
                    and Bubiyan Islands, to which Iraq ascribed importance because of the secure
                    access they afforded to its ports on the Khawr 'Abd Allah&#8212;the waterway to the
                    Persian Gulf that remained the only viable alternative to the closed Shatt
                    Al-'Arab, cluttered with debris from the Iran-Iraq War.
The dispute over the Bubiyan and Warbah Islands was a key point of contention in
                    the lengthy history of territorial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait. In 1961,
                    when the United Kingdom ended its protectorate over Kuwait, then Iraqi Prime
                    Minister General 'Abd Al-Karim Qasim asserted that Kuwait was an "integral part
                    of Iraq" because it had been part of the former Ottoman province of Al-Basrah.
                    Iraq threatened to exert its sovereignty over Kuwait, but the consequent
                    deployment of British troops to Kuwait forced the Iraqis to back down. Although
                    subsequent regimes relinquished this claim by recognizing Kuwait's independence,
                    Ba&#8217;athist Iraq never formally accepted a common boundary between the two
                    countries.
Still, there had been no major incidents regarding the border dispute until 1990,
                    when Iraq was in the throes of the postwar economic crisis. In July, Saddam
                    accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of breaking with Organization of
                    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production quotas and over-producing crude
                    oil for export, which depressed prices, depriving Iraq of critical oil revenues.
                    In addition, Saddam Hussein alleged that Kuwait was stealing oil from the
                    Rumayla oil field that straddled the Iraq-Kuwait border. He also demanded that
                    Kuwait cede control of the Bubiyan and Warbah Islands to Iraq.
During this period, there was a deterioration of relations between the United
                    States and Iraq. Iraq accused the United States and Israel of deliberately
                    weakening Iraq by encouraging Kuwait to reduce oil prices. When Iraq began to
                    threaten Kuwait early in July 1990, the United States staged maneuvers in the
                    Gulf to warn Iraq against taking military action against the United Arab
                    Emirates and Kuwait. Despite this show of U.S. force, President George H.W. Bush
                    adopted a conciliatory policy toward Saddam Hussein in hopes of moderating the
                    Iraqi regime and policies. The Bush administration tried to maintain economic
                    and political relations with Iraq, and on April 12, 1990, sent a delegation of
                    American senators led by Senator Robert Dole to meet with Hussein. Senator Dole
                    brought a message from the White House suggesting that the United States wanted
                    to improve relations with Iraq. A letter from President Bush to Saddam delivered
                    by U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie on July 27 echoed this sentiment.
But on August 2, 1990, a force of one hundred thousand Iraqi troops invaded
                    Kuwait and overran the country in a matter of hours. The invasion of Kuwait led
                    to a United Nations Security Council embargo and sanctions on Iraq and a
                    U.S.-led coalition air and ground war, which began on January 16, 1991, and
                    ended with an Iraqi defeat and retreat from Kuwait on February 28, 1991.
Although the United States was aware of Hussein&#8217;s threats to Kuwait, it did not
                    anticipate the Iraqi military incursion. The Iraqi Republican Guard units moved
                    toward Kuwait City while Iraqi Special Forces secured key sites, including the
                    islands of Warba and Bubayan, Kuwaiti air fields, and the palaces of the Emir
                    and the Crown Prince. There was some Kuwaiti resistance to the Iraqi invasion,
                    but the Iraqi forces easily suppressed Kuwait&#8217;s defenses. Members of the Kuwaiti
                    royal family escaped to Saudi Arabia where they appealed for international
                    support. On August 28, Iraq declared that Kuwait had become its nineteenth
                    province.
International condemnation of the Iraqi invasion was widespread and virtually
                    unanimous. Within days, the United States led efforts to organize an
                    international coalition, which, working through the United Nations Security
                    Council, passed Resolution 660 demanding Iraq&#8217;s immediate and unconditional
                    withdrawal, Resolution 661 imposing economic sanctions, and Resolution 663
                    declaring the annexation of Kuwait null and void.
The United States and Saudi Arabia agreed to a deployment of U.S. forces to Saudi
                    Arabia to protect the peninsula. At the same time, the United States and the
                    coalition insisted on Iraq&#8217;s unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, but Iraq
                    refused to withdraw and began looting Kuwait and destroying its
                    infrastructure.
By October 30, the Bush administration made a decision to push Iraq out of Kuwait
                    by force if necessary. Bush increased the U.S. force presence and petitioned the
                    United Nations for authorization to use force. The result was UN Resolution 678,
                    which authorized the use of force to compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, but
                    gave Iraq a forty-five day grace period to withdraw. Led by the United States,
                    an international coalition of nations amassed forces in the region to help
                    liberate Kuwait.
After the deadline for withdrawal passed, the coalition led by the United States
                    attacked Iraq by air. Within twenty-four hours, coalition forces controlled the
                    skies and bombarded such strategic sites as the Iraqi command and control
                    facilities, Saddam Hussein&#8217;s palaces, the Ba&#8217;th Party headquarters, power
                    stations, intelligence and security facilities, hydroelectric stations, oil
                    refineries, military-industrial complexes, and Iraq&#8217;s missile facilities.
                    Coalition aircraft subsequently targeted Iraqi troops in Kuwait
In retaliation, Saddam Hussein launched missile attacks against Israel and on
                    coalition force bases in Saudi Arabia. But Israel refused to retaliate and
                    coalition forces took the offensive by launching a land campaign that began on
                    February 24 and lasted four days. Comprising forces from thirty-four countries,
                    including a number of Arab countries, the coalition forces liberated Kuwait City
                    and drove Iraqi forces into a retreat. On March 2, the United Nations Security
                    Council passed Resolution 686, which set forth conditions for a cease-fire. Iraq
                    was obligated to accept its provisions, which included sanctions and payment of
                    reparations for war damages. Iraq was obligated to return property stolen from
                    Kuwait. The United States continued to put pressure on Iraq through the United
                    Nations, which passed Security Council Resolution 687 establishing the United
                    Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) to inspect Iraq&#8217;s suspected chemical and
                    biological weapons capabilities. The United States subsequently sought to ensure
                    that the trade embargo imposed on Iraq the previous year through Resolution 661
                    remained in place and that Iraq was stripped of chemical weapons and missiles
                    and its nuclear research capabilities. In the chaos following the war,
                    spontaneous Shiite rebellions in the South and Kurdish unrest in northern Iraq
                    broke out but were eventually suppressed by Saddam Hussein and his Revolutionary
                    Guards.
