Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), 1989






Milestones: 1989&#8211;1992








Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), 1989

Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, was formed in 1989 in Australia as an
                    informal forum in which member nations could discuss free trade and economic
                    cooperation along the Pacific Rim. From the perspective of the United States, it
                    has been a crucial institution for economic engagement within the region.

APEC was one of many multilateral trade organizations that emerged in the
                    post-Cold War era. As the bipolarity of the Cold War came to an end, the new
                    world order was marked in part by increasing globalization and the growth of
                    regional trading blocs. The United States took a leading
                    role in defining this new world order in which free trade and multilateral
                    organizations played an essential role. Although it assisted in the formation of
                    APEC, the U.S. Government played an even greater role in the creation of the
                    North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization
                    (WTO). All these organizations were based on identifying shared economic goals
                    and methods, but did not rely upon binding agreements, so states could continue
                    to act in their own interests. These entities aimed to eliminate trade barriers
                    and help states consider regional issues when making economic policy.
Although the countries bordering the Pacific Ocean were extremely diverse in
                    terms of linguistic, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, they shared rapidly
                    developing economic power and common economic interests. Recognizing this, a
                    number of countries in the region began to discuss the creation of a regional
                    organization that would promote free trade and further economic integration in
                    the hope that such a move would benefit the entire region. The resulting
                    organization, APEC, brought together developed and developing economies and
                    promoted the idea of a regional Pacific Rim identity in an effort to increase
                    Pacific-wide cooperation.
Since 1989, APEC has expanded from its original 12 members to include 21 member
                    economies. The founding members were Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada,
                    Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines,
                    Singapore, Thailand and the United States. In 1991, the People&#8217;s
                        Republic of China, Hong Kong and Chinese
                    Taipei joined the forum. Over the course of the 1990s, Chile, Mexico, Papua New
                    Guinea, Peru and Russia entered the organization. Together, the member economies
                    of APEC account for a substantial proportion of world economic activity.
During its first five years of operation, APEC established its core objectives.
                    In the 1991 Seoul Declaration, APEC member economies proclaimed the creation of
                    a liberalized free trade area around the Pacific Rim as the principle objective
                    of the organization. A 1994 meeting held in Bogor, Indonesia set as the
                    organization&#8217;s goal the achievement of &#8220;free and open trade and investment&#8221; for
                    the region, establishing 2010 as the target date for developed economies and
                    2020 for developing ones. Each subsequent annual meeting has addressed the
                    implementation of the Bogor Goals along with pertinent issues for the economic
                    and security interests of the member economies. The topics that may be addressed
                    at annual meetings are not proscribed, but the focus tends to be on trade
                    liberalization, promoting business, and economic cooperation.
The United States has long been an active participant in the activities of APEC.
                    In 1993 in Seattle, Washington, President Bill Clinton
                    hosted what became the first annual meeting of member economies&#8212;ministers and
                    economic leaders. This act displayed the U.S. commitment to working with APEC
                    member economies to achieve freer trade in the region. Since that time the
                    United States has maintained a high level of engagement with this key
                    organization.
