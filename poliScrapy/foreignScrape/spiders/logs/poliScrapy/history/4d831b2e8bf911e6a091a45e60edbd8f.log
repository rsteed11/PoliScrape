In\n                        keeping with this principle established in the President\u2019s December 2009 Open\n                            Government Directive, the Office of the Historian has adapted its publications to\n                        open digital formats that can be accessed and consumed easily by the public, including third\n                        party developers. In 2010, the Office of the Historian made the following submissions to\n                        data.gov, which remain up to date: \nBibliographic Metadata of the Foreign Relations of\n                                        the United States Series: Raw bibliographic metadata for the nearly\n                                500 volumes in the Foreign Relations of the\n                                        United States series published since 1861. Each record in the\n                                dataset contains a volume\u2019s title, year of publication, years covered by the volume,\n                                summary, and links to sources for these volumes online or in print, among other\n                                metadata items. [Data.gov catalog entry]\nLatest Volumes of Foreign Relations of the United\n                                        States Series: This atom feed lists the ten most recently published\n                                volumes in the Foreign Relations of the United\n                                    States series. Each record in the dataset contains a volume\u2019s title, year of\n                                publication, summary, and link to the online volumes. The feed is updated as soon as\n                                a new volume is published. [Data.gov catalog entry]\n\nBuilding on this foundation and extending the focus beyond data, the President\u2019s May 2012 Digital Government Strategy emphasized delivering better digital services to the\n                        American people government through mobile devices and providing automated services for third\n                        party web and app developers. In 2013, the Office of the Historian made the following\n                        contributions to the Digital Government Strategy: \nEbook Editions of Office of the Historian\n                                Publications: The Foreign Relations of the United States\n                                (FRUS) series, established in 1861, was adapted to ebook. Far lighter\n                                and more portable than printed editions of FRUS, the ebook edition offers\n                                the full content of each volume and makes use of the full-text search and other\n                                reading features of most ebook devices and applications, including bookmarking and\n                                note-taking. Unlike the web-based edition of FRUS, the ebook edition, once\n                                downloaded, can be accessed even without internet connectivity. The ebooks were\n                                generated from the master digital files at no additional cost and are available for\n                                free download.\nOffice of the Historian Ebook Catalog API: This Application Programming Interface\n                                (API) enables third party web and app developers, as well as users of these\n                                applications, to embed the Office of the Historian ebook catalog. The API uses best\n                                practices and open standards, including the\n                                Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) format for ebook catalogs and REST interfaces.\n\nSee also the Open Government Initiative, Digital Government Strategy, and Developer Resource pages on the Department of\n                        State\u2019s website.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Government Initiative\n\n\nBibliographic Metadata of the Foreign Relations of the United States Series\n\nLatest Volumes of Foreign Relations of the United States Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The Office\u2019s historians work closely with other federal government\n                            history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the\n                            globe. The Office is directed by Dr. Stephen\n                                Randolph, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.\n\n\nWhat We Do\nThe Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and\n                            publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the\n                            Foreign Relations of the United States series.\nIn addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for\n                            Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential\n                            background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify\n                            precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on\n                            institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make\n                            decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their\n                            choices. The Office of the Historian conducts an array of initiatives, ranging\n                            from briefing memos to multi-year research projects.\nThe Office of the Historian also promotes the declassification of documents to\n                            ensure a complete and accurate understanding of the past.\n\n\nForeign Relations of the United States\n\nThe Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series presents the official\n                            documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions. The series\n                            began in 1861 and now comprises more than 480 individual volumes.\nForeign Relations volumes contain documents from the Presidential libraries,\n                            Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central\n                            Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign\n                            affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in\n                            implementing U.S. foreign policy.\nLearn more about the series and view the collection at our Historical Documents page.\n\n\nOur Outreach Activities\nThe Office\u2019s public outreach activities include hosting scholarly conferences on\n                            key issues in the history of U.S. foreign policy, answering historical research\n                            questions, consulting with scholars, educators, and students, and working with\n                            high school teachers across the country to provide high-quality materials for\n                            classroom use.\n\n\nHow to Access Our Materials\nThe Office maintains a public website at history.state.gov,\n                            which provides in-depth information to the public on the history of U.S. foreign\n                            policy. In addition to a full text archive of\n                                the Foreign Relations series, the website includes valuable\n                            encyclopedic content on the history of U.S. relations\n                                with states around the world, a database of the Department\u2019s principal officers and\n                                chiefs of mission, and special tools and\n                                resources for students and teachers.\nIn keeping with the Open Government Directive\u2019s principle of transparency,\n                            participation, and collaboration as the cornerstone of an open government, the\n                            Office of the Historian has begun preparing many of its rich historical\n                            publications in a raw data format that can be accessed through data.gov.

This current list is based on\n                        information received from American diplomatic posts abroad, as well as web\n                        sources and communication with the archives themselves. The information provided\n                        here is subject to change so researchers are advised to contact the government\n                        or archive ahead of any planned visit. \nSelect an article from the list of all countries.\nWhile access to the diplomatic records of many countries remains highly\n                        restricted, the news is better than ever before with many new countries\n                        establishing Freedom of Information Acts to foment better government\n                        transparency. \nThe divide between the developed world and the developing world also affects the\n                        state of international archives. Problems of infrastructure inhibit the nature\n                        of information dissemination. The amount of information available on the\n                        internet varies from country to country and many National Archives and\n                        Ministries of Foreign Affairs are still in the process of developing workable\n                        websites.\nThis site does not comment on the state of the records themselves. In addition to\n                        the loss of records as a result of changes of government and civil war, the\n                        climate has wreaked havoc upon some archives, particularly in tropical regions,\n                        whose documents, despite the best efforts of archivists, have been compromised\n                        by heat, humidity, flooding, and frequent power outages.\nIn compiling this database, the Office of the Historian has tried to give\n                        researchers a starting place for their inquiries. We have not included anecdotal\n                        advice on how to approach any given archive. Countries that do not\n                        systematically declassify their documents may require personal contacts to gain\n                        access to records of interest. Additionally, compliance with laws that guide\n                        freedom of information may vary.\nFor the most part, diplomatic records are held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n                        (or a similar department) or have been transferred to a National Archive. If\n                        that is done systematically, it is usually apparent as to which records are\n                        available for viewing. When transfer is not systematic, it is up to the\n                        researcher to discover the location of the documents they wish to view as well\n                        as to make contact with the relevant archivist.\nThe Office of the Historian would be happy to receive updated or missing\n                        information.

Your style guide may require\n                    different formatting of a citation, so you may need to adapt the elements of the sample\n                    citations below to a specific format.\nCite document numbers rather than page numbers\nEvery document in the Foreign Relations series since the 1955\u201357 subseries has been\n                    assigned a sequential number unique within the volume. The advantage of citing a Foreign\n                        Relations document by its document number is that, unlike page numbers, the numbers\n                    are media neutral and remain consistent across different media: print, web, and ebook. An\n                    example of a citation to document number is as follows:\nForeign Relations\n                        of the United States, 1969\u20131976, Volume XIX, Part 1, Korea, 1969\u20131972, eds. Daniel\n                    J. Lawler and Erin R. Mahan (Washington: Government Printing Office, 2010), Document\n                    75.\nThe components of this citation are as follows:\n\nSeries title: Foreign Relations of the United States\n\nSubseries title: 1969\u20131976\nVolume number: Volume XIX, Part 1\nVolume title: Korea, 1969\u20131972\nEditors (not to include the General Editor): Daniel J. Lawler and Erin R. Mahan\nCity: Washington, D.C.\nPublisher: Government Printing Office\nYear published: 2010\nLocation within the volume: Document 75\n\nCite volumes by URL\nParticularly if you consulted the web or ebook edition of a Foreign Relations\n                    volume, we recommend appending the canonic URL for the volume (or document) to your\n                    reference. This will allow readers to directly access the source. Taking the previous\n                    citation as an example, the following URL would be appended to the end of the citation,\n                    often including a date the material was accessed:\nhttp://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v19p1/d75 [accessed 27 Oct\n                    2011]\nURLs to Foreign Relations documents always follow this structure: the Office of the\n                    Historian\u2019s website domain (\u201chttp://history.state.gov\u201d), section (\u201chistoricaldocuments\u201d),\n                    volume identifier (\u201cfrus1969-76v19p1\u201d), and document identifier (\u201cd75\u201d).\nA scanned image of the original printed page (or scanned document, in the case of certain electronic-only\n                    volumes) is available for citation by URL. You can find these URLs in the right sidebar of\n                    each document, labeled "View Image." For example, the sidebar for document 75 contains links to\n                    the images of pages 190, 191, and 192. Notice that in these\n                    page-number-based URLs, the document identifier (\u201cd75\u201d) is substituted with the page number\n                    identifier (\u201cpg_190\u201d, etc.).\nCitations to ebook editions are no different for these examples.\nWhen citing a document number is not possible\nSince volumes before the 1955\u201357 subseries did not include document numbers, citations must\n                    reference page numbers:\nForeign Relations\n                        of the United States, 1952\u20131954, General: Economic and Political Matters, Volume I,\n                    Part 1, eds. David M. Baehler, Herbert A. Fine, Ralph R. Goodwin, N. Stephen Kane, Ronald D.\n                    Landa, Lisle A. Rose, William F. Sanford, Jr., and Ilana M. Stern (Washington: Government\n                    Printing Office, 1983), 798\u2013800.\nDocument numbers have been superimposed on the web and ebook edition of all these earlier\n                    volumes that have been digitized, so that every document has a unique URL. But take caution\n                    that readers of the print edition will not be able to locate a citation in these volumes by\n                    document number (e.g., the web edition of the above citation appears as \u201cDocument 221\u201d). \nVariations in the titles of early Foreign Relations volumes\nEarly editions of the Foreign Relations series used a variety of titles. For\n                    example:\nPapers Relating\n                        to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1918, Russia, Volume III\n                    (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1932), 51.\nPapers Relating\n                        to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1893 (Washington: Government\n                    Printing Office, 1894), 452\u2013453.\nMessage of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the\n                        Commencement of the Third Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress (Washington:\n                    Government Printing Office, 1862), 356\u2013370.\n(For more information on the titles, see the discussion of the term \u201cForeign\n                        Relations series\u201d in the history of the Foreign Relations series.)\nAlso, earlier volumes typically do not identify the editors, in which case the names of\n                    editors can not be included in a citation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Documents\n\n\nBrowse official documents from the published Foreign Relations of the United States series.\n\n\nBrowse by Administration\n\n\nPre-Truman Volumes\n\nTruman Administration\n\nEisenhower Administration\n\nKennedy Administration\n\nJohnson Administration\n\nNixon Administration\n\nFord Administration\n\nCarter Administration\n\nReagan Administration\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Resources\n\n\nMore about\n                            the Foreign Relations series\n\nStatus of the Series\n\nHistory of the Series\n\nForeign Relations Ebooks\n\nOther Electronic Resources for\n                            U.S. Foreign Relations\n\nGuide to Sources on\n                            Vietnam, 1969-1975\n\nTips for searching the Foreign Relations Series\n\nHow to cite Foreign Relations documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push([\'_setAccount\', \'UA-23344799-1\']);\n          _gaq.push([\'_setDomainName\', \'history.state.gov\']);\n          _gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement(\'script\'); ga.type = \'text/javascript\'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = (\'https:\' == document.location.protocol ? \'https://ssl\' : \'http://www\') + \'.google-analytics.com/ga.js\';\n              var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\'script\')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);\n          }})();\n        \n\n',

All searches are case-insensitive, so searching for \u201cSALT\u201d will\n                    return the same results as searching for \u201csalt.\u201d You can refine a query by (1) narrowing its\n                    scope to specific sections of the website or to specific Foreign Relations volumes\n                    and (2) using phrase, boolean, wildcard, and proximity operators in your search. Use the\n                    following techniques and syntax to improve your search results. Click on each example to\n                    pre-fill the search form with the parameters of your search, and then submit the search to\n                    see the results.\n* Note that the search engine\u2019s results are limited to the materials that the Office of the\n                    Historian has digitized. Please consult the full list of Foreign Relations volumes\n                        by administration to see which volumes have been\n                    digitized (indicated by the phrase, \u201cfull text,\u201d next to each volume\u2019s title), and consult\n                    the University of Wisconsin Madison\n                            FRUS collection or a library near you for access to volumes not yet\n                    available here.\n\nScope\nBeneath the keyword search field is a set of checkboxes. Selecting any of the checkboxes\n                        can narrow the scope of your search, resulting in a faster, more specific query. The\n                        default set of checkboxes contains the major content sections of the website: Historical\n                        Documents, Department History, Milestones, Countries, Conferences, Educational\n                        Resources, FRUS Sesquicentennial, and About (FAQ, Advisory Committee Minutes). You can\n                        also select specific Foreign Relations volumes. To search for articles about\n                        U.S. diplomatic history that relate to peace:\npeace (with the \u201cDepartment History\u201d and \u201cMilestones\u201d checkboxes selected) \nIf no checkboxes are selected, the entire site will be searched. To achieve the best\n                        results, combine scope with the following search operators:\n\n\nPhrases\nWhen you type your search terms into the box, the search engine will search for those\n                        terms, individually, anywhere in a document. To force the search engine to find fixed\n                        phrases (i.e., specific, ordered combinations of words), place the phrase in quotation\n                        marks. To locate documents which include both \u201cpeaceful\u201d and \u201cnuclear\u201d anywhere in the\n                        text, use the following search:\npeaceful nuclear\n\nTo locate documents which use the phrase \u201cpeaceful nuclear,\u201d use this search:\n"peaceful nuclear"\n\n\n\nBooleans\nThe search engine will allow you to perform Boolean searches (AND, OR, and NOT). Boolean\n                        operators must be in all caps.\nYou can use Boolean operators with individual terms or with phrases enclosed in quotation\n                        marks. For example, to locate documents which include both the word \u201cKissinger\u201d and the\n                        phrase \u201cpeaceful nuclear,\u201d use this search:\nKissinger AND\n                            "peaceful nuclear"\n\nTo locate documents which include either \u201cRhodesia\u201d or \u201cZimbabwe,\u201d use this search:\nRhodesia OR Zimbabwe\n\nTo locate documents which include the phrase \u201carms control\u201d but exclude documents which\n                        also include the term \u201cSALT,\u201d use this search:\n"arms control" NOT SALT\n\nYou can also use the plus (+) and minus (-) signs to include or exclude certain terms. To\n                        search for documents which must include the phrase \u201claw of the sea\u201d and may include the\n                        term \u201cseabed,\u201d use this search:\n+"law of the sea" seabed\n\nTo search for documents which include \u201cKorea\u201d but not \u201cDMZ,\u201d use this search:\nKorea -DMZ\n\nFinally, you can use parentheses to nest your searches. To find documents which include\n                        \u201cGuatemala\u201d or \u201cEl Salvador\u201d and \u201cBelize,\u201d use this search:\n(Guatemala OR\n                            "El Salvador") AND Belize\n\n\n\nWildcards\nIf you are unsure about the spelling of a term or want to find variants of a term, you\n                        can use wildcards. The search engine supports two wildcard characters: ? and *.\nIf you want to replace a single letter in your search term, use ? in your query. To find\n                        documents which include \u201ctext\u201d or \u201ctest,\u201d use this search:\nte?t\n\nNote that the above search will not return hits for \u201cTet\u201d or \u201cteapot.\u201d If you want to\n                        replace zero or more letters in your search term use * in your query. For example, to\n                        find documents which include \u201cVietnam\u201d and \u201cVietnamese,\u201d use this search:\nVietna*\n\nNote that the above search will not return hits for \u201cViet Nam,\u201d another spelling of the\n                        same country. You may have to try multiple variants of the same search to get all the\n                        results you need.\n\n\nProximity\nIf you are searching for common words, you can tell the search engine to only return\n                        documents in which the words are within a distance you define. To find documents which\n                        include \u201cCuba\u201d and \u201csubmarine\u201d within 10 words of each other, use this search:\n"Cuba submarine"~10\n\nWe are aware that \u201ckeyword in context\u201d summary of the results of proximity searches are\n                        not displaying correctly. The search results themselves, however, are reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push([\'_setAccount\', \'UA-23344799-1\']);\n          _gaq.push([\'_setDomainName\', \'history.state.gov\']);\n          _gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement(\'script\'); ga.type = \'text/javascript\'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = (\'https:\' == document.location.protocol ? \'https://ssl\' : \'http://www\') + \'.google-analytics.com/ga.js\';\n              var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\'script\')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);\n          }})();\n        \n\n',

Keefer, John M. Carland, and Bradley L. Coleman\n                        Office of the Historian, U.S. Department of State\n                        Released February 1, 2012\nThe Vietnam war is one of the best documented events in U.S. history.\xa0\n                        Federal agencies generated a large and unique variety of archival material\n                        during the conflict, from traditional memoranda and telegrams, to\n                        backchannel messages and White House tape recordings.\xa0 This guide to\n                        archival resources, based on the work of the Office of the Historian, U.S.\n                        Department of State, describes the sources used to compile the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) documentary\n                        series on the Vietnam war during the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford\n                        Administrations, from January 1969 to May 1975.\xa0 Despite the expansive\n                        coverage dedicated to the Vietnam war in the Foreign\n                        Relations series, space constraints forced Department of State\n                        historians to choose carefully among the thousands of documents produced\n                        during the conflict.\xa0 This guide aims to provide a road map for researchers\n                        seeking to go beyond documents included in Foreign\n                        Relations to archival resources housed both in Washington and in\n                        various locations around the country.\xa0\xa0\nIn compiling the Foreign Relations series, Department\n                        of State historians had a very specific mission to capture: the documentary\n                        record of high-level policy decisions and civilian direction and management\n                        of the war; U.S. political and military strategy; peace negotiations with\n                        the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the National\n                        Liberation Front (NLF); U.S. support for the armed forces of the Republic of\n                        Vietnam (South Vietnam); and diplomatic, political, and economic relations\n                        with South Vietnam.\xa0 The five Foreign Relations\n                        volumes covering the Nixon and Ford administrations contain notes on\n                        sources, annotated source lists, and copious footnotes.\xa0 Readers should use\n                        this guide in conjunction with the published volumes.\xa0 Before undertaking\n                        archival research, researches should study carefully the documentation\n                        contained in the Foreign Relations volumes on Vietnam\n                        from 1969 to 1975.\xa0 Researchers can purchase the volumes through the U.S.\n                        Government Printing Office or view them free of charge on the Office of the\n                        Historian, U.S. Department of State website (http://history.state.gov).\xa0 In\n                        keeping with prevailing scholarly practices, documents researchers initially\n                        encounter in the series should be cited to Foreign\n                        Relations.\nDuring the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, the President directed that the\n                        U.S. military limit operations to South Vietnam, with the exception of the\n                        U.S. air campaign against the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the intermittent bombing\n                        of the North during Rolling Thunder.\xa0 Department of State historians\n                        covering this period determined it desirable to segregate the conflicts in\n                        Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into separate Foreign\n                        Relations volumes.\xa0 When Richard Nixon entered office in January 1969,\n                        however, the President and Special Assistant for National Security Henry\n                        Kissinger expanded the war beyond South Vietnam into enemy sanctuaries in\n                        Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam.\xa0 For this reason, Foreign Relations volumes covering Vietnam during this phase of the\n                        war document events across Southeast Asia, including activities such as the\n                        invasions of Cambodia (1970) and Laos (1971); the widespread bombing of\n                        North Vietnam (1972); and the SS Mayaguez incident\n                        (1975).\nAfter a careful reading of the Foreign Relations\n                        volumes, researchers should consult the extensive Presidential papers and\n                        other White House records at the Nixon Presidential Materials Project.\xa0 In\n                        2010 the Nixon records were transferred from the National Archives in\n                        College Park, Maryland to the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda,\n                        California.\xa0 Within this collection, the most valuable information bearing\n                        on the administration\u2019s management of the Vietnam War and its search for a\n                        negotiated peace in Southeast Asia are the National Security Council (NSC)\n                        Files.\nTwo sub-files within the NSC materials provide the best documentation: the\n                        Vietnam Subject Files and the Country Files for Vietnam.\xa0 These files hold\n                        the working records of the NSC staff members responsible for analyzing\n                        information on Vietnam for Kissinger, who in turn would use their analyses\n                        in his communications with President Nixon.\xa0 The Vietnam Subject Files is a\n                        topical collection that deals not only with Vietnam but also with Laos,\n                        Cambodia, Thailand, and Southeast Asia as a whole.\xa0 For example, material on\n                        the 1971 U.S.-supported South Vietnamese cross-border operation, Lam Son\n                        719, is in the Vietnam Subject Files under the sub-file Special Operations\n                        File.\xa0 Although the Vietnam Subject Files collection is weighed towards\n                        military issues, it also contains abundant records on the attempt to manage\n                        the peace process in Vietnam after January 1973.\xa0 Like other Nixon records,\n                        the archivists have prepared finding aids with folder titles.\xa0 The Vietnam\n                        Country Files collection, consisting of 29 Hollinger boxes, holds diplomatic\n                        and political material primarily about Vietnam and U.S. relations with the\n                        Republic of Vietnam.\xa0 The boxes, folders, and items within are organized\n                        chronologically.\xa0 In some cases there are sub-chronologies in each folder of\n                        Department of State cables, intelligence cables, and memoranda.\xa0 The Vietnam\n                        Country Files is the single most cited collection in the five Foreign Relations volumes on Vietnam from 1969 to\n                        1975.\nThe Far East Country Files, 31 Hollinger boxes, contain folders on Cambodia,\n                        Laos, Southeast Asia, Indochina, and Thailand.\xa0 Although similar in\n                        organization to the Vietnam Country Files, it lacks specific subject\n                        folders, but does include topical and issue-specific folders.\xa0 Additionally,\n                        there is a Cambodian Operations File, consisting of 21 Hollinger boxes, that\n                        contains a combination of chronological and topical records covering the\n                        U.S.-South Vietnamese movement into Cambodia from April to July 1970.\xa0 The\n                        files consist mostly of daily situation and action reports, including many\n                        to the President, as well as longer reports and briefings to Congress and\n                        others on the Cambodian operation.\xa0 The Nodis/Khmer section of this file\n                        focuses on efforts by various nations to support the Cambodian effort.\nThe search for a negotiated peace is a principal theme of the Foreign Relations coverage of the Vietnam war.\xa0 Official\n                        peace negotiations were held in Paris at the International Conference Center\n                        on Avenue Kl\xe9ber.\xa0 Documentation on these talks, consisting of some 28\n                        Hollinger boxes, is located in the Paris/Talks Meeting Files.\xa0 This file\n                        begins during the Johnson administration and contains the records\u2014mostly\n                        cables to and from the delegation in Paris\u2014of the W. Averell Harriman and\n                        Cyrus Vance Mission (HARVAN), from May 1968 to January 1969.\xa0 During the\n                        Nixon administration, the file covers cable traffic between the Department\n                        of State and the delegation in Paris, and to and from the Embassy in\n                        Saigon.\xa0 There are a few topical folders in the collection with\n                        non-telegraphic material, but it is essentially a cables file with the bulk\n                        of the material dated between 1969 and 1970.\nThe Nixon administration preferred to use private talks in Paris, as opposed\n                        to the official public sessions at Avenue Kl\xe9ber, as the primary venue for\n                        serious negotiations. In August 1969, Washington and Hanoi opened a secret\n                        negotiations channel.\xa0 At these discussions, Kissinger represented the\n                        United States and Hanoi\u2019s Chief Delegate at Paris Xuan Thuy, later joined by\n                        Special Adviser Le Duc Tho, represented North Vietnam.\xa0 Le Duc Tho was a\n                        member of the Politburo in Hanoi and the real chief of the delegation.\xa0 The\n                        records of the Kissinger and Xuan Thuy-Le Duc Tho negotiations were\n                        maintained by NSC staff member Winston Lord, the principal note taker for\n                        these secret meetings, and are located in the NSC Files, For the\n                        President\u2019s\u2014China/Vietnam Negotiations, C.D. [Camp David].\xa0 This file\n                        includes virtually all verbatim memoranda of the secret talks, as well as\n                        summary memoranda prepared by Kissinger and his staff for the President.\xa0\n                        This collection also reveals how Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and South\n                        Vietnamese President Thieu kept abreast of the negotiations.\xa0 In all, the\n                        Vietnam negotiations portion of the file maintained by Winston Lord fills 24\n                        Hollinger boxes.\xa0 A second file by the same name exists in the NSC Files,\n                        and consists of 3 Hollinger boxes containing mostly copies of Kissinger\u2019s\n                        secret talks with Le Duc Tho, original letters from Thieu to Nixon from late\n                        1972 to early 1973, and memoranda of conversations for Kissinger\u2019s trip to\n                        South Vietnam in October 1972 and Haig\u2019s trip in November 1972.\nAs for U.S.-Soviet relations, the Nixon administration wanted Moscow to\n                        pressure North Vietnam into a political settlement.\xa0 To this end, Nixon and\n                        Kissinger engaged in private talks with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Fedorovich\n                        Dobrynin.\xa0 Nine Hollinger boxes of records related to those meeting are in\n                        the NSC Files, President\u2019s Trip File, Dobrynin/Kissinger.\nFollowing the aforementioned collections, next in importance are several\n                        other collections within the NSC Files.\xa0 The first is the Backchannel Files\n                        which contain secret communications between the White House (essentially the\n                        President or Kissinger) and U.S. ambassadors, conducted without the\n                        knowledge of the official Department of State bureaucracy. Although the\n                        collection includes all backchannel messages, a good portion relate to\n                        backchannel messages between the White House and Ambassadors Bunker and\n                        Graham A. Martin in Saigon, and to and from other ambassadors in Southeast\n                        Asia.\xa0 For 1969, however, backchannel communications between the White House\n                        and Ambassador Bunker are filed in the Vietnam Subject File.\xa0 On almost all\n                        occasions, these backchannel messages were more important to the policy\n                        process than the regular Department of State telegrams.\xa0 Backchannel\n                        messages to and from U.S. negotiators in Paris are also in this\n                        collection.\nThe Kissinger Office Files\u2014the records of the Special Assistant to the\n                        President for National Security Affairs maintained by his immediate\n                        staff\u2014are also in the NSC Files.\xa0 A key source for documents on U.S. policy\n                        toward Vietnam, this collection contains Kissinger\u2019s trip files, items such\n                        as briefing books, memoranda, and memoranda of conversations relating to his\n                        travels.\xa0 These records cover his visit to Saigon in October 1972 to confer\n                        with President Nguyen Van Thieu; his negotiating sessions in Paris with Le\n                        Duc Tho; his February 1973 Hanoi visit; and activities related to the June\n                        1973 Joint Communiqu\xe9.\xa0 The Kissinger Office Files also have separate\n                        Country Files, Far East, sub-section that contains records on Cambodia,\n                        especially relating to the efforts of Colonel Jonathan \u201cFred\u201d Ladd, sent to\n                        Phnom Penh by the President, to bolster the fighting ability of Lon Nol\u2019s\n                        armed forces.\xa0 A Vietnam-South Vietnam Country File, which covers 1971\u20131972\n                        and contains a sub-section on Vietnam-Vietnam Negotiations, are also in the\n                        Office Files but, it should be emphasized, the most important material on\n                        this issue is in the For the President\u2019s Files.\nValuable documents relating to Vietnam are in other collections in the NSC\n                        Files.\xa0 The Haig Chronological Files includes memoranda, correspondence, and\n                        message traffic to and from Haig, much of it relating to Vietnam.\xa0 It also\n                        contains one box of transcripts of a number of telephone conversations among\n                        Haig, Nixon, Kissinger, and other NSC staff members.\xa0 These transcripts do\n                        not seem to appear elsewhere and often contain significant policy\n                        discussions.\xa0 The Haig Special File has material arranged topically, much of\n                        which relates to Haig\u2019s trips to South Vietnam (aimed at informing President\n                        Thieu about the state of the negotiations and, more importantly, at\n                        persuading him to accept the American proposals and approach).\xa0 This file\n                        also includes documents on Haig\u2019s trips to other Southeast Asian nations.\xa0\n                        The Agency File, Department of Defense, contains considerable documentation\n                        on Vietnam, while the Subject Files (as opposed to the Vietnam Subject\n                        Files) hold only occasional Vietnam-related items, some of which is useful,\n                        such as Items to Discuss with the President.\xa0 A chronological collection of\n                        documents within the NSC Files, the President\u2019s Daily Briefing Files often\n                        include reports on Vietnam with handwritten comments by President Nixon.\xa0\n                        Finally, the Unfiled Material contains documentation on Vietnam.\xa0 Made up of\n                        material not filed after the President resigned, the collection has no\n                        finding aid or organizational logic except that it is organized by\n                        date\u2014earliest to latest.\xa0 There is no easy way to review it except document\n                        by document.\nThe NSC Files in the Nixon Presidential Materials also contain the National\n                        Security Council Institutional Files (H-Files), which should not to be\n                        confused with the NSC Institutional Matters File (a sub-file of the NSC\n                        Files comprising 19 boxes).\xa0 The H-Files, consisting of 315 boxes, until\n                        recently were under the control of the NSC but have now been transferred to\n                        the Nixon Presidential Library.\xa0 These files contain the minutes of National\n                        Security Council Meetings and NSC subgroups such as the Review Group/Senior\n                        Review Group and the Washington Special Actions Group (WSAG), chaired by\n                        Kissinger and attended by deputy heads of the federal agencies and the\n                        Director of Central Intelligence.\xa0 Furthermore, for each set of minutes\n                        there are corresponding folders containing papers Kissinger used to prepare\n                        for the meetings.\xa0 For Vietnam and Southeast Asia, the WSAG functioned as\n                        the key policy and crisis management entity.\xa0 It dealt, sometimes on a daily\n                        basis during critical periods, with events in Vietnam and Southeast Asia,\n                        making policy decisions, or asking the President to make the decisions, and\n                        following up on Presidential directives.\xa0 In addition, this file hold\n                        records of the Vietnam Special Study Group (VSSG), a White House dominated\n                        organization established to provide the President and Kissinger with\n                        independent analysis and advice. Also of value in the Institutional\n                        (H-Files) are the National Security Study Memoranda/National Security\n                        Decision Memoranda (NSSM/NSDM) Files, containing requests for studies, the\n                        studies themselves, and resulting decision memoranda.\nWhile the NSC Files and the NSC Institutional Files are the premier\n                        collections for Vietnam and Southeast Asia, additional useful collections\n                        exist in the Nixon Presidential Materials.\xa0 For example, in the White House\n                        Special Files one finds the H. R. Haldeman Files, which holds Haldeman\u2019s\n                        handwritten accounts of his daily activities.\xa0 During his time at the White\n                        House, Haldeman at first wrote and later dictated a daily diary.\xa0 Although\n                        not a foreign policy expert, he was a close confidant of the President and,\n                        as Chief of Staff, very close to, and observant of, the decision making\n                        process.\xa0 His diary is a treasure trove of great historical significance.\n                        Available on compact disk (The Haldeman Diaries, the\n                        Multi-Media Edition), a selection of key entries have been published in\n                        book form by G. Putnam and Sons as The Haldeman Diaries:\n                        Inside the Nixon White House.\xa0 Additionally, the Nixon Presidential\n                        Diary, an appointments diary indicating where the President was and with\n                        whom he met or spoke on a given day, is an essential tool for researchers\n                        and is found in the White House Central Files, Staff Member and Office\n                        Files.\nThe archival sources at the Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan,\n                        offer the best coverage of the final months of the Vietnam war, including\n                        domestic political activities, the evacuation of Phnom Penh and Saigon, and\n                        the SS Mayaguez affair.\xa0 The Presidential Country\n                        Files for East Asia and the Pacific contain invaluable documents, including\n                        memoranda, correspondence, telegrams, and reports.\xa0 Organized by country\n                        name, there are 10 Hollinger boxes with materials exclusively related to\n                        U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia.\xa0 The NSC East Asia and Pacific Affairs\n                        Staff Files offer additional documentation, including a chronological file,\n                        SS Mayaguez papers, and items generated for WSAG and\n                        NSC meetings.\xa0 Valuable backchannel communications with Ambassador Martin\n                        and other Southeast Asian ambassadors fill 2 Hollinger boxes.\xa0 Additionally,\n                        the library houses Ford administration H-Files, which include briefing\n                        books, memoranda, and WSAG meetings minutes produced during the U.S.\n                        evacuation of Cambodia and South Vietnam.\xa0 A small collection of National\n                        Security Agency material at the Ford Library includes the text of helicopter\n                        radio communications during the April 1975 emergency.\xa0 Researchers should\n                        also consult the Agency Files, NSC Vietnam Information Group Files, NSC\n                        Congressional Relations Files, NSC Meeting files, Kissinger and Scowcroft\n                        West Wing Files, Brent Scowcroft Daily Work Files, White House Central\n                        Files, Legislative Inter-Departmental Working Group Files, and Wolfgang\n                        Lehmann Papers.\xa0 The library maintains detailed findings aids (available\n                        online) for each collection.\xa0 There are also 10 Hollinger boxes of documents\n                        removed from the Embassy by Ambassador Martin during the evacuation, a\n                        unique collection considering the embassy staff destroyed or scattered most\n                        records covering the period from 1974 to 1975 during the final days in\n                        Saigon.\xa0 Combined with the Martin backchannel messages, these records offer\n                        a detailed account of the Embassy\u2019s experience, important considering the\n                        Ambassador\u2019s great personal influence on the handling of the evacuation.\nThe Henry Kissinger Papers at the Library of Congress are likewise valuable.\xa0\n                        Although the collection is not open to the public, Kissinger permitted\n                        Department of State historians access to these records for use in the Foreign Relations series.\xa0 Material in the papers often\n                        replicate documents found in other collections; it nonetheless holds some\n                        unique material.\xa0 Foremost in this category are the transcripts of Kissinger\n                        telephone conversations based on notes taken by a secretary listening in on\n                        the phone at Kissinger\u2019s office at the White House or transcribed from tapes\n                        recordings from his home telephone.\xa0 Needless to say, the Kissinger\n                        telephone conversations are a key source for Vietnam War policy.\xa0 While\n                        general researchers cannot use the transcripts at the Library of Congress,\n                        Kissinger has allowed copies to be transferred to the National Archives,\n                        where most are open to the public.\nOther than the transcripts of telephone conversations, Kissinger\u2019s speeches\n                        and writings, and his Record of Schedule (appointment diary), the Kissinger\n                        Papers are segregated into a classified file (secret and below), a\n                        top-secret file, and a section containing a limited amount of restricted\n                        data and special compartmentalized information.\xa0 In this material, the best\n                        collection for Vietnam and Southeast Asia is the Geopolitical File, which\n                        contains a wide-ranging section on Vietnam and smaller files on Cambodia and\n                        Laos.\xa0 Also of value within the Kissinger Papers are the Memoranda to the\n                        President File, the Memoranda of Conversations File, and the Presidential\n                        File.\xa0 However, none of these deal exclusively with Vietnam and Southeast\n                        Asia.\nThe Department of State, Department of Defense, and to a lesser extent the\n                        Central Intelligence Agency, although strong bureaucratic players in the\n                        Johnson Administration\u2019s policymaking, played a reduced role under President\n                        Nixon and Henry Kissinger, who concentrated policymaking in the White\n                        House.\xa0 The files of the Department of State, especially the Central Files\n                        and certain Lot Files, are valuable for tracking events in Vietnam, Laos,\n                        and Cambodia, and at the Paris Talks.\xa0 Before Kissinger became Secretary of\n                        State in September 1973, Department of State records offer poor coverage of\n                        U.S. policy toward Southeast Asia, because Nixon and Kissinger intentionally\n                        excluded the Secretary of State and the Department from the Vietnam\n                        decision-making process.\xa0 Still, some of the Central Files are useful for\n                        political, economic, and military developments in Southeast Asia from 1969\n                        to 1974, including POL 27 CAMB/KHMER, POL 27 LAOS, and POL 27 VIET S.\xa0 While\n                        ostensibly the designation for military operations in Vietnam, and to a\n                        lesser extent Laos and Cambodia, POL 27 became a catchall file.\xa0\n                        Consequently, it is a good source of material for those interested in\n                        political developments in Saigon, Vientiane, or Phnom Penh.\xa0 In the Lot\n                        Files one finds Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker\u2019s weekly and later monthly\n                        summaries of events in South Vietnam to President Nixon.\xa0 They covered in\n                        detail the government, politics, the economy, and the war.\xa0 Although the\n                        President rarely read the reports, they nonetheless provide a useful account\n                        of important events in South Vietnam; they have been collected and published\n                        as The Bunker Papers, Reports to\n                        the President from Vietnam, 1967\u20131973 (Berkeley, 1990).\xa0 The Central\n                        Files offer Vietnam-related documents through mid-1973, after which the\n                        Department captured memoranda, telegrams, and other records electronically.\xa0\n                        Researchers can search and retrieve these later items through a National\n                        Archives archival database.\nBeginning in September 1973, when Kissinger became the Secretary of State,\n                        the Department again played an active role in the policymaking process.\xa0 The\n                        Records of Henry Kissinger (26 Hollinger boxes), 1973\u20131977, Entry 5403,\n                        Record Group 59, at the National Archives contain documents related to\n                        Vietnam.\xa0 The Transcripts of Secretary of State Kissinger\u2019s Staff Meetings\n                        (11 Hollinger boxes), Entry 5117, Record Group 59, are also useful.\xa0\n                        Researchers may likewise consult the U.S. Foreign Service post records.\xa0\n                        Although they offer little on high policy, the post files are filled with\n                        reports and communications on local conditions and activities.\xa0 In the\n                        absence of U.S. initiative after mid-1973, moreover, the story of U.S.\n                        involvement in South East Asia often centers on embassy activity.\xa0 The post\n                        files, however, provide inconsistent coverage of U.S. activities abroad\n                        because many records did not survive the fall of Saigon.\xa0 The best\n                        preserved, the Phnom Penh Embassy Files, Record Group 84, offer detailed\n                        coverage of U.S. activities in Cambodia.\xa0 Large portions of the Saigon\n                        Embassy collection, on the other hand, were lost in 1975.\xa0 The most complete\n                        collection of Saigon Embassy documents for the period from 1974 to 1975 is\n                        located at the Ford Library, not the National Archives.\xa0 Also, while they\n                        offer thin coverage of the years between 1969 and 1974, the Lot Files of the\n                        Bureau of East Asian Affairs Files, Record Group 59, can be useful for\n                        researchers interested in the ending of the Vietnam War.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records are essential for documenting\n                        the role of intelligence in the war in Southeast Asia.\xa0 Even so, the most\n                        important finished intelligence can be found in the Nixon Presidential\n                        Materials, NSC Files.\xa0 The CIA prepared a daily briefing for the President\n                        on Vietnam that is in the National Security Council Files, President\u2019s Daily\n                        Briefings.\xa0 Additionally, useful collections under CIA\u2019s physical custody\n                        are the National Intelligence Center (NIC) Files, which contain many\n                        intelligence estimates and memoranda.\xa0 Of particular significance are the\n                        records of George Carver, Special Assistant for the Director of Central\n                        Intelligence (DCI), for Vietnam Affairs.\xa0 As the CIA\u2019s foremost Washington\n                        expert on Vietnam and Southeast Asia, his files are central to understanding\n                        the interplay between intelligence and foreign policy.\xa0 The same is true for\n                        the DCI (Helms) Files and DCI Executive Registry Files, although these files\n                        also include material on non-Vietnam issues that engaged the DCI.\xa0 The\n                        National Intelligence Council\u2019s Estimative Products on\n                        Vietnam, 1948\u20131975, published in 2005, contains a good selection of\n                        intelligence estimates on Vietnam.\xa0 In most cases, Foreign\n                        Relations volumes print only the summaries of the National Intelligence\n                        and Special Intelligence estimates while the full texts are published in the\n                        in the NIC publication.\xa0 Intelligence Files for the Nixon and Ford\n                        Administrations, including the records of the 303 Committee/40 Committee and\n                        related subject files for Vietnam and Southeast Asia were particularly\n                        valuable for documenting covert operations and unconventional warfare.\xa0 They\n                        are currently in the custody of the National Security Council, but are\n                        destined for the Nixon and Ford Presidential Libraries.\xa0 A Department of\n                        State Lot file, the INR/IL Historical Files, holds valuable material for\n                        these topics and is similar to the Nixon Intelligence Files.\xa0 These files\n                        remain in the control of the Department of State.\nThe Department of Defense and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird were key\n                        players in the formation of policy towards Vietnam.\xa0 Department of State\n                        historians conducted extensive research in the Department of Defense records\n                        now housed at the Washington National Records Center in Suitland, Maryland.\xa0\n                        Still classified, these files include secret and top-secret documents,\n                        organized by office, year, and subject.\xa0 These files will likely move to the\n                        National Archives in College Park upon declassification.\xa0 The Defense\n                        Secretary\u2019s key memoranda are almost always in the NSC Files in the Nixon\n                        and Ford collections.\nAt the Ford Library, a collection of documents covers Laird\u2019s tenure as\n                        Secretary of Defense.\xa0 His staff chose these Laird Papers at the end of his\n                        term as Secretary of Defense with a view to documenting his major decisions\n                        and accomplishments.\xa0 The Papers of James R. Schlesinger, Secretary of\n                        Defense from 1973 to 1975, are located at the Library of Congress.\xa0\n                        Schlessinger\u2019s collection holds memoranda, reports, and communications\n                        related to his government service, but is not yet open to the public.\xa0 Major\n                        portions of the Laird and Schlesinger collections concern Vietnam, Cambodia,\n                        and POW/MIA affairs.\xa0 In addition, the official files of the Secretary of\n                        Defense, Under Secretary of Defense, and their Assistants, plus the records\n                        of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs,\n                        have large sections devoted to Vietnam and Southeast Asia.\nDefense related records that were not available when the first volumes were\n                        being researched, but are worthy of mention as sources, are the records of\n                        the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in Record Group 218 at the National\n                        Archives\u2014specifically those of General Earle G. Wheeler, Chairman,\n                        1964\u20131970; Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, 1970\u20131974; and General George S. Brown,\n                        1974\u20131978\u2014in the National Archives.\xa0 The most useful sections of these\n                        records are the Chairman\u2019s correspondence to and from the Commander,\n                        Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, correspondence to and from the\n                        Commander in Chief, Pacific Command, and additional miscellaneous Vietnam\n                        related documents in various country folders.\nAnother JCS collection, Admiral Moorer\u2019s Diary, reveals significant\n                        information about the policymaking process.\xa0 Only made available when the\n                        final Foreign Relations volumes in the Vietnam series\n                        were being researched, the Diary contains entries for practically every day\n                        during his tour of duty as Chairman.\xa0 Each day\u2019s entry contains a series of\n                        sub-entries about meetings (in his office, in Secretary Laird\u2019s, at the\n                        White House, or elsewhere), telephone conversations, or reflections on\n                        policy matters and other topics.\xa0 Appended to most daily entries are one or\n                        more documents.\xa0 Especially useful to the researcher are memoranda for the\n                        record Moorer drafted after meetings with President Nixon or with Kissinger,\n                        internal memoranda from one of his own subordinates or external ones from\n                        Kissinger or Kissinger\u2019s Deputy, Alexander M. Haig, or from other members of\n                        the Nixon Administration.\xa0 What gives special value to the already immensely\n                        valuable diary and its attached documents is that Moorer taped and\n                        transcribed many of his telephone conversations and attached the transcripts\n                        to the Diary.\xa0 These transcripts of conversation\u2014a few with Nixon but more\n                        often with Kissinger; Haig; Laird; Admiral John S. McCain (Commander in\n                        Chief, Pacific); Generals Creighton W. Abrams and Fred C. Weyand (theater\n                        commanders in Saigon); and the Admiral\u2019s own senior subordinate at the\n                        Pentagon\u2014reveal the extraordinary and substantial role Moorer played in the\n                        formation and implementation of U.S. national security policy in Southeast\n                        Asia.\nAfter February 1971, the White House Presidential Recordings are a critical\n                        source for understanding Vietnam policy developments and to a lesser extent\n                        for policy in Cambodia and Laos.\xa0 The recordings that are transcribed and\n                        cited in the Foreign Relations volumes comprise only\n                        a small portion of the recordings available.\xa0 Using the tape log, and\n                        comparing entries with the meetings and conversations for which there are\n                        written records, the editors and the Nixon Tape team at the Office of the\n                        Historian have selected policy-significant recordings of meetings and\n                        telephone conversations. While tape conversations are difficult to\n                        transcribe and do not always lend themselves easily to insertion in\n                        documentary publication, the selection presented in these volumes is a\n                        representative of the larger body of conversations. Nixon and his close\n                        confidants spent hours talking in the President\u2019s Oval and Executive Office\n                        Building office. Their conversations were often unstructured and repetitive,\n                        their language frank, raw, and often uncomplimentary to individuals and\n                        institutions.\xa0 While it is the immediacy and apparent unguarded natured of\n                        recorded conversations, whether of individuals talking on a telephone or in\n                        an office, that give such conversations the reputation for truthfulness they\n                        enjoy among historians and others, it should be emphasized that it is just\n                        as possible to shade the truth, or lie, in conversations as it is in the\n                        more calculated act of writing.\xa0 At the same time, when recordings exist, as\n                        the Nixon White House tapes do, they become an integral part of the\n                        historical record and impose on historians the obligation to exploit them as\n                        best they can.\xa0 These tapes are an almost breathtaking resource but must be\n                        used with caution and viewed within the broader context.\xa0 Volumes in the Foreign Relations series provide just such a context.\nWhat makes the Nixon administration\u2019s records on Vietnam especially revealing\n                        is the existence of these unique sources.\xa0 The presidential tapes\n                        recordings, the Kissinger telephone conversations, the Haldeman Diaries, and\n                        the Moorer Diary and telephone conversations provide an added dimension of\n                        documentary material.\xa0 Taken in conjunction with the more traditional\n                        records, these special sources deepen one\u2019s understanding of the characters\n                        involved and how they interacted with others and with the circumstances they\n                        encountered.\xa0 By extension, they also provide a great understanding of the\n                        policymaking process.\nIn sum, the records of the Nixon and Ford administrations on Vietnam are a\n                        rich and abundant resource but pose some substantial challenges to\n                        researchers.\xa0 Even with five volumes covering the conflict from 1969 to\n                        1975, only a small fraction of the total documentation will be printed in\n                        the Foreign Relations series.\xa0 The editors of these\n                        volumes believe, however, that they have selected the most significant\n                        documents available for understanding the policy process.\xa0 Furthermore, they\n                        have added value to their selections through annotation and editorial\n                        notes.\xa0 While Department of State historians have had to make difficult\n                        choices, they believe that the resulting documentary collections provide a\n                        solid account of policy decisions by the Nixon and Ford Administrations on\n                        the Vietnam War and will stimulate additional research on U.S. involvement\n                        in the still-controversial war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Documents\n\n\nBrowse official documents from the published Foreign Relations of the United States series.\n\n\nBrowse by Administration\n\n\nPre-Truman Volumes\n\nTruman Administration\n\nEisenhower Administration\n\nKennedy Administration\n\nJohnson Administration\n\nNixon Administration\n\nFord Administration\n\nCarter Administration\n\nReagan Administration\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Resources\n\n\nMore about\n                                the Foreign Relations series\n\nStatus of the Series\n\nHistory of the Series\n\nForeign Relations Ebooks\n\nOther Electronic Resources for\n                                U.S. Foreign Relations\n\nGuide to Sources on\n                                Vietnam, 1969-1975\n\nTips for searching the Foreign Relations Series\n\nHow to cite Foreign Relations documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Most recently, the essays\n                    covering the Kennedy and Johnson (1961\u201368), Nixon and Ford (1969\u201376), Carter (1977\u201380), Reagan (1981\u201388), Bush (1989\u201392), and Clinton (1993\u20132000) administrations were revised and\n                    expanded. These same essays were also enhanced with \u201ctags,\u201d or lists of the key people,\n                    places, and topics in the essay. The tags appear as links in the right sidebar of the essay\n                    and facilitate discovery of other other essays and resources, including volumes from the\n                        Foreign Relations of the United States series, on these subjects. The \u201ctags\u201d\n                    feature is still in progress, and over time the Office will extend the tags to all of the\n                    essays.\nTo begin, select a period from the sidebar, or view a list of all milestones.\nLast updated: November 1, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilestones\n\n\n1750-1775\n\n1776-1783\n\n1784-1800\n\n1801-1829\n\n1830-1860\n\n1861-1865\n\n1866-1898\n\n1866-1898\n\n1899-1913\n\n1914-1920\n\n1921-1936\n\n1937-1945\n\n1945-1952\n\n1953-1960\n\n1961-1968\n\n1969-1976\n\n1977-1980\n\n1981-1988\n\n1989-1992\n\n1993-2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Ross, Foreign Service Officer, U.S. Department of State\n\n\n\nTranscript\nMS ROSS: In 1918, the Diplomatic Courier Service was established to support the\n                            work of American diplomats by ensuring that classified messages and materials were\n                            delivered safely and securely to U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. In the\n                            1950s, before the onset of the jet age, this small group of couriers traveled tens of\n                            thousands of miles per year, often spending months on the road. One of the trips they\n                            made was from Pakistan to Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass.\nMR VERREOS: The most interesting travel that I had was while I was in Manila and\n                            detailed to Karachi, which at that time was the capital of Pakistan, and Karachi is\n                            where we served Afghanistan.\nMR COOPER: Well, many couriers would agree with me that it was one of the most\n                            exciting trips we were taking at that time \u2013 just the mere fact that it was over the\n                            Khyber Pass.\nMR HOHMAN: The Khyber Pass was an exciting, interesting, unsettling sort of a\n                            trip. \nMR COOPER: At that time, we had a trunk route that went from Manila to Paris. I\u2019d\n                            fly out to Karachi, making the usual stops on the way, and instead of continuing on to\n                            Paris, I would relieve a courier on the Karachi detail. He would continue on to Paris,\n                            and I would stay there for two months until I was relieved.\nMS DUNN: And the trip left Manila to Bangkok, Bangkok to Karachi. And then Karachi\n                            then down to Ceylon, which is Sri Lanka now. And then they would come back to Karachi,\n                            then they would head north to Peshawar and then by car through the Khyber.\nMS DIECKMAN: So we went from Hong Kong to Singapore, and I think I must have\n                            travelled then from Singapore to New Delhi, and from there taken a train to Peshawar,\n                            where I was to meet a courier in Peshawar for the rest of the trip to Kabul, which I\n                            didn\u2019t know how that was all going to happen but I was assured that it was very easy and\n                            very interesting \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and I would love it.\nMS DUNN: During my tour, they always went by car, and there were always \u2013 there\n                            was always danger: flashfloods and bandits.\nMR HOHMAN: The political circumstances were such that the air link had broken. We\n                            were using land transport. In an embassy, you\u2019d have a carry-all vehicle to go through\n                            the Khyber Pass.\nMR VERREOS: We would take the train from Karachi to Peshawar, overnight at the\n                            Dean\u2019s Hotel, and the embassy in Kabul would send down their vehicle and driver who\n                            would meet us and pick us up in the morning \u2013 the next morning. And then from Peshawar,\n                            we would go through the Khyber Pass to go into Afghanistan.\nMR COOPER: We traveled alone with an Afghan driver. We had two drivers I recall\n                            particularly, Abdul Ainan (ph) and Abdul Adjan (ph). Most of the time, we made it pretty\n                            much nonstop \u2013 first over the Khyber Pass and then over the Hindu Kush into Kabul.\nMR VERREOS: The embassy had a specially built Ford. By using the motor of the car\n                            as a power source, they had lathes and welding apparatus to repair the axles that would\n                            be broken on the trip up to Kabul.\nMS DUNN: And my driver was Abdul, an Afghan, and he\u2019d brought the courier down\n                            from \u2013 the courier down from Kabul and dropped him off that morning. I almost fainted\n                            when he came in; it was Jim Verreos. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Then we started up, and\n                            dirt sides of the roads, camels, and trucks coming down with the bodies hanging on with\n                            their robes flapping in the wind. There\u2019s not much greenery at all. If there was\n                            pavement, it\u2019s covered with dirt. And then it just \u2013 and it kind of just goes over to\n                            the side, and it\u2019s all just dirt. You could slide off.\nMR HOHMAN: Going through the Khyber Pass, and there really wasn\u2019t much space. It\n                            was a relatively narrow road. It was two-way traffic, but it was close two-way traffic,\n                            winding through upwards and of course downward.\nMS DIECKMAN: The road was bumpy and dusty. And I looked to the right as we were\n                            driving along, and oh, my gosh, we were thousands of feet above any ground down there.\n                            And I thought, ooh, there\u2019s no barricade or fence or lines in the road or anything. We\n                            just had to count on the driver. Well, he did this for a living, so we hoped that he\n                            remembered how to do it all. The mountains were absolutely wonderful. They were so high\n                            and so beautiful.\nMR COOPER: On the \u2013 interesting: On the side of the road \u2013 I don\u2019t know what kind\n                            of stone it is, probably granite \u2013 they had carved the crests of all the various British\n                            regiments that had served in this fort over the years, and their regimental crests were\n                            all carved on the stone along there. It was very interesting to see. The fort itself was\n                            up much higher.\nMS DUNN: And of course, the Khyber Rifles up at the top. There \u2013 this was their\n                            armory or stronghold up on the \u2013 up at the top and that\u2019s where they were stationed. It\n                            was something to see that you read about.\nMR VERREOS: You got to this high point where the Pakistanis had set up their\n                            border control station, then you would show your exit papers to exit Pakistan, and it\n                            was a little wooden shack and there was one telephone pole. I\u2019d say about 20 yards in\n                            front of that shack \u2013 this is really nice to look at \u2013 there was two posts and a wire\n                            fence and a gate, but on the other side there was nothing there. And you could walk\n                            around it, but they\u2019d put that fence up, and this was the entry into Afghanistan. And I\n                            inquired. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this telephone pole doing here?\u201d And they had in that Afghan\n                            office, they had a bunch of people down there writing down messages. That was the one\n                            phone line from Kabul to the border, but you couldn\u2019t make a telephone call outside the\n                            country. You could call and send your message to the station there at the Pakistan-Kabul\n                            border, they would write it down, walk it across the border, put the money in, and they\n                            would then telephone New York or London or wherever they wanted to telephone, and pass\n                            the message on.\nMS DUNN: So we start up and we get to the border, and I can\u2019t get in. \u201cYour visa\n                            has expired.\u201d So Abdul said, \u201cAll right, no problem. We\u2019ll start back.\u201d Well, he\u2019s\n                            careening down the Khyber back to the consulate in Peshawar, the Afghan consulate. We\n                            got there just before 12 o\u2019clock, they stamped my passport, and then I said, \u201cIs there a\n                            ladies\u2019 room here?\u201d And he says, \u201cWhat\u2019s a ladies\u2019 room?\u201d Well, then I had to go back to\n                            the staff house, scared them, and then we took off again. Anyway, we get through the\n                            Khyber, get through the border, and he says \u2013 Abdul says, \u201cNotice the nice, smooth roads\n                            we have here in Afghanistan.\u201d Well, a lot better than the dirt roads in the Khyber.\nMR VERREOS: There was no paved road inside the Afghan side. A few hundred yards\n                            off, you could see the Kabul River, and it was green for about a hundred yards off of\n                            the river on each side, and after that was desert \u2013 rocky. In the far distance you could\n                            see the Hindu Kush Mountains, and we were headed toward those Hindu Kush Mountains,\n                            roughly following a course that followed the Kabul River. And my driver told me this was\n                            the regular caravan route, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to follow,\u201d and I said, \u201cHow come?\u201d\n                            He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll try to point them out to you.\u201d At different points along it there\n                            would be a small pile of rocks on this side and on that side, and your road was in\n                            between those.\nMS DIECKMAN: And I was looking around for the road, and I didn\u2019t see one, and so I\n                            asked. I said, \u201cWhere \u2013 what road are we taking?\u201d And they said, \u201cRoad?\u201d (Laughter.)\n                            But the driver apparently knew his way because we did get to Kabul.\nMR VERREOS: On several trips, I encountered caravans, camel caravans coming or\n                            going along that route. On one of my trips, I got trapped. We were going through the\n                            Kabul River gorge, and there had been a tremendous rainstorm or something and there had\n                            been a washout of the road. And we came up to it; there were a whole bunch of camels and\n                            what have you in front, and the driver stopped. There was a small, about two-foot \u2013 two,\n                            three-foot wide section of the mountainside, and people could pass on foot. And I sent\n                            my driver up to see if he could negotiate with any cars that were trying to come this\n                            way that couldn\u2019t come. We would trade \u2013 the occupants of the car that was, say,\n                            southbound would use the embassy car to go to down to Peshawar, and the courier \u2013 myself\n                            \u2013 could use his car to go up to Kabul. And he said there were two cars on the other side\n                            and none of them agreed to that. There was no sense in staying there. I asked him, \u201cIs\n                            there any other way to get to Kabul?\u201d And the driver said yes, there was. So I said,\n                            \u201cWell, let\u2019s try that.\u201d \nSo \u2013 and then we backed out of there, and it was hard because we had to move camels and\n                            what have you, and donkeys, in order to back out of that narrow part of the gorge. And\n                            once we got out of the narrow part he took off and found some small town on the side.\n                            Fortunately, the driver, who was Pakistani, spoke Afghan. He got me accommodations in a\n                            \u2013 at a vacant wooden shack, no bed or anything, just a wooden floor. \nThe next morning we took off and we drove \u2013 finally got into Kabul. Meanwhile, Kabul had\n                            sent somebody down the regular road to find me, who reported he couldn\u2019t find me and he\n                            reported back by radio. And finally, when I got up there they were a little pissed that\n                            I had moved instead of stayed there and waited for help. But you have to \u2013 my concern:\n                            I had the pouches; I\u2019m not going to sit on a river gorge there hoping somebody might\n                            come. I felt it was my duty \u2013 just common sense. I was either going to go back to\n                            Peshawar or up to Kabul. And since my driver said there was a second way to Kabul, I\n                            preferred to take the second road to Kabul and accomplish my mission, which I did. But\n                            like I said, it was kind of a small adventure.\nMS DUNN: And then we were going to start up the gorge, and we started out, and up,\n                            up, up, up, and the canyons \u2013 it\u2019s just so deep. And there was a truck coming around the\n                            corner with more flapping robes, and he wants to know do I want to take a picture. Oh,\n                            no, no. (Laughter.) Oh, that was the scariest, scariest ride I ever had.\nMS DIECKMAN: So we got to Kabul, and Kabul was a very busy place because we landed\n                            right about where the market was, which was very, very busy with a lot of people going\n                            up and down and around and about, and carrying things and buying things. \nMR COOPER: Well, it could hardly be much more primitive. I remember all of the\n                            roofs of the houses, the roofs were made of mud. You got too much rain, you were in\n                            trouble. And I think I was told that there were only two buildings in Kabul that had\n                            corrugated tin roofs, and one of them was the American embassy, and I forget what the\n                            other one was.\nMS DIECKMAN: The one thing I really noticed is that the women had so much cloth\n                            on. It went down to the floor and covered a lot of their head and all of their body, and\n                            it\u2019s what you really noticed, it\u2019s there is a woman in there. (Laughter.)\nMR HOHMAN: I wandered around a little bit between the time we were ready to set\n                            off for the run to Jalalabad, but they told me not to wander around too much in the\n                            streets because people had a tendency to disappear. It was still a rough country. \nWhat was rather interesting is the various clothing that the Afghans were wearing, and\n                            quite often you\u2019d see castoff American uniforms from the Second World War \u2013 coats,\n                            raincoats that they had; sometimes you\u2019d see somebody wearing an Eisenhower jacket over\n                            a long, flowing robe.\nMS DUNN: I was there a week. I thought it was very nice. We played golf \u2013 nine\n                            holes. The ball, you\u2019d hit it and it\u2019d hit a rock and then it would ricochet, and there\n                            was deep, deep grass. I don\u2019t know how the caddies ever found the ball. Just to say we\n                            played golf in Kabul.\nMR COOPER: We decided to climb up the mountain to where they have a cannon\n                            mounted. There was an old boy that used to fire that cannon off at noon every day. He\n                            was very proud of this gold watch that he would produce, and he\u2019d mark it down and wait\n                            till noon, and then he\u2019d light the fuse on the cannon, then it would go off. So I didn\u2019t\n                            know how accurate his watch was. (Laughter.) Well, it pretty much established noon in\n                            Kabul. We called it \u201cKabul boom time.\u201d (Laughter.)\nMS DUNN: And even when I was there in \u201973, we stopped at a \u2013 along the Khyber, we\n                            stopped at a stronghold of some type, and the guy came out and he had bandoliers across\n                            his chest and a big rifle. And I thought, \u201cWell, then not much has changed.\u201d \nMR VERREOS: Believe me, like I said, that was about the most interesting trip in\n                            the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment History\n\n\nShort History\n\nBuildings of the Department\n\nPeople\n\nBiographies of the Secretaries\n                                        of State\n\nPrincipal Officers and\n                                        Chiefs of Mission\n\n\n\nTravels\n\nTravels of the Secretary\n\nTravels of the President\n\n\n\nVisits by Foreign Leaders\n\nWorld War I and the Department\n\nU.S. Diplomatic Couriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In contrast to the well known record of U.S. actions after it\n                    entered the war in April 1917, the stories of U.S. diplomats, consuls, and their family\n                    members\u2014particularly during the early months of the crisis (August-December 1914)\u2014were long\n                    forgotten, overshadowed by subsequent events of the tumultuous twentieth century. By\n                    researching U.S. Government and Government of France records, memoirs, personal papers, and\n                    newspaper archives, this study presents a fascinating account of how actions spearheaded by\n                    U.S. diplomats\u2014and American citizens\u2014significantly strengthened Franco-American relations in\n                    unique, unparalleled ways.\n\nDownload PDF (818 KB)\n\n\nThe Office of the Historian has released this electronic preview edition of \u201cViews From the Embassy: The Role of the U.S. Diplomatic Community in France, 1914\u201d\n                    (PDF, 818 KB). Over the upcoming months, this preview edition will be superseded by a more\n                    complete version. The material complements U.S. Embassy France\u2019s WWI Centennial page. Readers\n                    may view full copies of several documents referenced in \u201cViews From the Embassy\u201d through\n                    links on the Embassy\u2019s WWI Interactive Timeline.\nThe material in \u201cViews From the Embassy\u201d differs substantially from documentation printed in the\n                        Foreign Relations of the United States volumes covering World War I, which\n                    focus upon high policy decisions and matters of international law rather than\n                    on-the-ground operations. Readers may access Foreign Relations of the United\n                        States volumes, such as the 1914 War Supplement\n                        volume, through the Office of the Historian website.\n\nThe Office of the Historian is grateful to the following institutions that provided\n                    assistance on this project: The American Hospital in Paris; The American Chamber of Commerce\n                    in Paris; Columbia Center for Oral History Collection, Columbia University (Reminiscences of\n                    DeWitt Clinton Poole Jr.); Harvard University Archives, Harvard University (Robert &\n                    Mildred Bliss Papers); Moorland-Springarn Research Center, Howard University (William H.\n                    Hunt Papers); The Sheridan Libraries Special Collections, The Johns Hopkins University (John\n                    Work Garrett Papers); Western Reserve Historical Society (Myron T.

The Department of State\n                            maintains a list of current Senior Officials and\n                                Chiefs of\n                                Mission.\n\n\n\nAll Principal\n                                    Officers and Chiefs of Mission, Listed by Name\n\nAll Principal\n                                    Officers and Chiefs of Mission, Listed by Year\n\nPrincipal\n                                    Officers, Listed By Title\n\nChiefs of Mission, Listed by Country\n\nChiefs of Mission, Listed By International Organization\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis online resource continues a 1991 publication of the Office of the\n                        Historian, Principal Officers of the Department of State and United\n                            States Chiefs of Mission. Our intent is to document the history of\n                        U.S. representation abroad and the chief policymakers in the Department of\n                        State. To that end, we have provided a chronological listing of principal\n                        officers\u2014essentially all Department officers at the level of assistant\n                        secretary or above\u2014and chiefs of mission. (See below for a discussion of the\n                        term, \u201cchief of mission.\u201d) These two categories require Presidential or\n                        Secretarial designation, and, in some cases, the approval of the Senate. We\n                        have made an attempt to comprehensively list all people selected for these\n                        positions, even if they were not approved by the Senate, died before taking\n                        office, declined the position, or were otherwise unable to serve. For that\n                        reason, the pages which list our chiefs of mission by country are split into\n                        two categories: \u201cChiefs of Mission\u201d lists those who held the office, and\n                        \u201cOther Nominees\u201d lists those who did not.\nPositions Included\nThis database includes officers of the Department who were presidential\n                        appointees (appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the\n                        Senate) and chiefs of bureaus who hold rank equivalent to Assistant\n                        Secretary of State. These include: Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Under\n                        Secretaries, Deputy Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Counselors,\n                        Legal Advisers, Chiefs of Protocol, and certain administrators.\nOther positions have, from time to time, been included in the database based\n                        on their particular circumstances. The complete lists of heads of the United\n                        States Information Agency, for example, are included. USIA was incorporated\n                        into the Department in 1999. Other chiefs of mission of particular\n                        historical interest have also been included.\nPositions Excluded\nThis database does not include representatives, personal\n                        representatives, or special representatives of the President or Department\n                        of State; charg\xe9s d\u2019affaires or charg\xe9s d\u2019affaires ad interim (except under\n                        certain circumstances); individuals holding diplomatic commissions jointly\n                        with other representatives; special agents and other individuals on special\n                        missions; high commissioners; chiefs of mission in charge of special\n                        economic or aid missions; liaison officers; military governors or commanding\n                        officers of occupying forces or their political advisers; delegates to\n                        international conferences; or consular officers who held only consular\n                        commissions.\nWhat is a Chief of Mission?\nAccording to the Foreign Affairs Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-465, Section\n                        102(3) (22 U.S.C. 3902)) a Chief of Mission is \u201cThe principal officer in\n                        charge of a diplomatic mission of the United States or of a United States\n                        office abroad which is designated by the Secretary of State as diplomatic in\n                        nature, including any individual assigned under section 502(c) to be\n                        temporarily in charge of such a mission or office.\u201d\nThe Chief of Mission is often \u2013 but not always \u2013 an Ambassador. There are\n                        currently three classes of diplomatic representation established by the 1961 Vienna\n                            Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Article 14: ambassador or nuncio\n                        (accredited to the Head of State); envoy, minister, or internuncio\n                        (accredited to the Head of State); and charg\xe9 d\u2019affaires (accredited to the\n                        Minister of Foreign Affairs). These classes have a much longer lineage.\n                        Although not a signatory, the United States followed Annex 17 to the\n                        Congress Treaty of Vienna (March 19, 1815) which established rank and\n                        precedence of diplomatic agents (ambassadors, envoys, and charg\xe9s\n                        d\u2019affaires). The Proces-Verbal of the Conference of Aix-la-Chapelle\n                        (November 9, 1818), recognized ministers resident as an intermediate class\n                        between Ministers and charg\xe9s d\u2019affaires.\nThe United States first used the rank of Ambassador in 1893, when Thomas F.\n                            Bayard was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain on March 30 of that\n                        year.\nA \u201ccharg\xe9 d\u2019affaires ad interim\u201d refers to a diplomat temporarily acting for\n                        an absent chief of mission. This database tracks all charg\xe9 d\u2019affaires and\n                        charg\xe9 d\u2019affaires ad interim who served (1) for a continuous period of 12\n                        months or more, (2) at the establishment or ending of diplomatic relations\n                        with a country, or (3) at the closure or opening of an embassy.\nDatabase Contents\nThe type of information for each entry included varies based on the type of\n                        position. Entries will have some or all of these pieces of information:\n\nName\nWhen possible, the full name of the appointee has been included.\nYears of birth and death\nState of residency\nThe appointee\u2019s state or territory of legal residence at the time of the\n                            appointment is taken from the commission, nomination, or a contemporary\n                            official record of legal residence. If the residence was omitted from\n                            these sources, the entry does not appear. Some officers changed their\n                            legal residence during their careers; in such cases the entry for their\n                            various appointments reflects the change in residence.\nCareer status\nAppointees are not categorized as \u201ccareer\u201d or \u201cnon-career\u201d before the\n                            passage of the Foreign Service Act of February 5, 1915, which\n                            restructured the Diplomatic and Consular Services. For Chiefs of Mission\n                            holding office at that date, an asterisk by their names in the\n                            alphabetical listing denotes those who were at the time of appointment\n                            (or who had previously been for at least five years) Foreign Service\n                            officers, Foreign Service information officers, or career officers in\n                            the Diplomatic or Consular Services. The asterisk also indicates those\n                            few individuals who served as diplomatic secretaries, who had then been\n                            commissioned before as Chiefs of Mission or as Presidential appointees\n                            in the Department of State, who were not serving as Chiefs of Mission in\n                            February 1915, but who were subsequently appointed or reappointed as\n                            such. All other appointees have no asterisk, even though they may have\n                            been career officers in the civil or military services. Career status\n                            reflects an individual\u2019s status at the time of appointment. For example,\n                                Richard Holbrooke served in the Foreign Service, but was not a\n                            career member of the Foreign Service when appointed to his various\n                            positions, so he is listed as \u201cnon-career.\u201d\nDates of service\nThese dates are included on a position-by-position basis. Principal\n                            officers of the Department who are presidential appointees have a date\n                            of appointment, date of entry on duty, and date of termination of\n                            appointment. An effort has been made to fix a date for the termination\n                            of the diplomatic mission of each representative vis-\xe0-vis the host\n                            government and to describe briefly in each individual case (and as\n                            precisely as sometimes incomplete records permit) what action or event\n                            brought the mission to either a formal or a de facto close. In the\n                            nineteenth century it was customary for a Chief of Mission to present\n                            his own letter of recall; in current practice most missions terminate in\n                            actual fact with the departure of the Ambassador from his post. In all\n                            periods there have been special circumstances (e.g., death, declaration\n                            of war, severance of diplomatic relations) which have brought some\n                            diplomatic missions to an end. It should be emphasized that the\n                            effective date of a Chief of Mission's resignation frequently does not\n                            coincide with the date shown here for the termination of his or her\n                            mission abroad. For those who were designated by the Secretary, the date\n                            of appointment is the same as the date of entry on duty. For charg\xe9s\n                            d\u2019affaires ad interim, dates of service are listed from and to the\n                            nearest month.\n\nKey Terms\n\nAppointment\nThe date of appointment is that which appears upon the face of the\n                            Presidential commission issued to the appointee. It is frequently\n                            referred to as the date of commissioning or the date of attestation.\n                            Recess appointments are valid only until the end of the current session\n                            of the Senate. If the President wishes to keep a recess appointee in\n                            office, the President must re-nominate the appointee.\nCommission\nA document attesting that the appointee has been appointed as a\n                            principal officer of the Department or as a Chief of Mission. It is\n                            signed by the President and the Secretary of State and bears the\n                            impression of the Great Seal of the United States. \u201cCommission\u201d always\n                            connotes Presidential action.\nDesignation\nThis term covers chiefs of bureaus of the Department who are selected by\n                            the Secretary of State. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states\n                            that \u201cthe Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior\n                            Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of\n                            Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\u201d \u201cDesignation\u201d always connotes\n                            Secretarial action.\nNomination\nThis is the date that the President sends to the Senate the name of a\n                            person whom he wishes to appoint to a high-level position. Article II,\n                            Section 2 of the Constitution states that the President, \u201cby and with\n                            the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other\n                            public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other\n                            Officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein\n                            otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law.\u201d Per Senate Rule XXXI, \u201cNominations that are not confirmed or\n                            rejected are returned to the President at the end of a session or when\n                            the Senate adjourns or recesses for more than 30 days.\u201d\n\nSteps in Appointment\nNomination is the first step in the appointment process. The President\n                        submits the name of the person to be appointed to a high-level position to\n                        the Senate for approval by first the Foreign Relations Committee and then by\n                        the full Senate. Approval by the full Senate is called \u201cConfirmation.\u201d The\n                        appointee is then commissioned. After taking the oath of office, he or she\n                        enters on duty.

The first Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. \nWorld War I (1914\u20131918) and World War II (1939\u20131945) brought vastly increased global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent power.  New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, included:\n                    \nthe newly independent states,\nthe global economy,\nterrorism, and\nthe security of the American overseas presence. \n\nTo address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to:\n                    \n1,228 in 1900,\n1,968 in 1940,\n13,294 in 1960,\nand 15,751 in the year 2000.\n\nThe number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and continues to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment History\n\n\nShort History\n\nBuildings of the Department\n\nPeople\n\nBiographies of the Secretaries\n                                        of State\n\nPrincipal Officers and\n                                        Chiefs of Mission\n\n\n\nTravels\n\nTravels of the Secretary\n\nTravels of the President\n\n\n\nVisits by Foreign Leaders\n\nWorld War I and the Department\n\nU.S. Diplomatic Couriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

    FRUS ebooks been tested with?\nA: We have tested FRUS ebooks on a range of devices and apps: iOS\n                            applications include iBooks, ShuBook, MegaReader, Kobo, Bluefire Reader, Subtext,\n                            and the Kindle app. Kindle devices include the Keyboard and Fire models. Android\n                            apps include Bluefire and Alkido. We encourage users of other devices and\n                            apps to report their experiences.\n\n\nQ: How can I add a FRUS ebook to\n                            my device?\nA: Until FRUS ebooks are available through commercial ebook retailers,\n                            there are two primary methods for adding a FRUS ebook to your device: (1)\n                            \u201cSide-loading\u201d an ebook from this website onto your device or (2) Using an\n                            application that embeds our catalog and lets you browse and download directly from\n                            the application. It is important to understand what methods and apps are available\n                            on your device.\n\n\u201cSide-loading\u201d FRUS Ebooks\n\nQ: How can I load \u201cside-load\u201d ebooks onto my device?\nA: Consult the instructions provided by your app developer or device manufacturer to\n                            \u201cside-load\u201d the ebook file into your e-reader.\n\niBooks (Apple iOS): Select \u201cCan I download books from other\n                                    websites?\u201d under \u201cManaging your books and iBookstore content\u201d from the iBooks: Frequently Asked\n                                        Questions\n\nAmazon Kindle: Search Kindle Support for \u201ctransferring\u201d and select instructions specific\n                                    to your device/app\nBarnes & Noble Nook: Search Nook\n                                        Support for \u201cside-load\u201d and select instructions specific to your\n                                    device/app\n\n\n\nEmbedding our Ebook Catalog in Apps\n\nQ: How can I add the Office of the Historian\u2019s\n                            ebook catalog to my favorite ebook app?\nA: A growing number of apps support the OPDS standard, allowing these apps to embed\n                            the Office of the Historian\u2019s ebook catalog and offer browsing, downloading, and\n                            reading within the application. The Office of the Historian\u2019s ebook catalog URL (an\n                            OPDS API) is http://history.state.gov/api/v1/catalog. To add our catalog to your\n                            OPDS-compliant ebook application, consult the directions, and enter this URL where\n                            directed. We have tested ShuBook and MegaReader on iOS and the IbisReader web\n                            application. Please submit your feedback about these or other applications to history_ebooks@state.gov.\nIf you are a developer of ebook applications and would like to incorporate the\n                            Office of the Historian ebook catalog into your application, please see our Developer Resources page.\n\nCiting FRUS EBooks\n\nQ: Since ebooks do not have stable page\n                            numbers, how can I cite references to FRUS ebooks?\nA: Use document numbers rather than page numbers. Document numbers are persistent, media-neutral identifiers. For example, to cite this\n                            memorandum from the SALT I, 1969-1972 volume, use: U.S. Department of State, Foreign\n                                    Relations of the United States, 1969-1976, Vol. XXXII, SALT I,\n                                        1969-1972 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2010),\n                                Doc. 262. rather than U.S. Department of State, Foreign\n                                        Relations of the United States, 1969-1976, Vol. XXXII, SALT I,\n                                            1969-1972 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2010),\n                                    774-781.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\nIssue: FRUS ebook footnote\n                            behavior on Kindle devices and the Kindle app.\nDecription: Footnotes are hyperlinked in FRUS ebooks so that activating a\n                            footnote reference will navigate directly to the text of the footnote (and vice\n                            versa). On Kindle devices and apps, activating the hyperlink from the footnote text\n                            back to the footnote reference in the document will navigate to the content\n                            immediately following the reference.\nIssue: Indexes in pre-Johnson era FRUS\n                            refer to page numbers rather than document numbers\nIn creating the FRUS ebook edition, we endeavored to maintain fidelity with the\n                            original printed edition. Representing original page numbers from printed editions in ebooks\n                            has proved to be difficult. For readers who need to cite material in this ebook, we\n                            recommend citing document numbers instead of page numbers. Document numbers are persistent,\n                            media-neutral identifiers. Please note that since the indexes in older FRUS volumes\n                            refer to page numbers rather than document numbers, we have found certain indexes cannot be\n                            used \u201cas is\u201d in ebook versions and so have been omitted from the ebook edition of\n                            pre-Johnson administration volumes. Volumes from the Johnson administration onward, whose\n                            indexes reference document numbers, are unaffected by this issue.\n\nHelpful Tips\n\nTip: Using bookmarks.\nDescription: Many e-readers allow users to set multiple bookmarks and navigate to\n                            them quickly from an easily-accessible list of all the assigned bookmarks in a given\n                            ebook. FRUS ebook users can take advantage of this feature to place\n                            bookmarks on frequently-used resources, like the Persons, Source, and/or the Terms\n                            and Abbreviations lists that are located at the beginning of each volume. Many\n                            e-readers also allow you to jump back to a previous location, making it easy to take\n                            advantage of the information in a FRUS ebook\u2019s front matter without losing\n                            your place in the volume.\nTip: Using the table of contents.\nDescription: In addition to a hyperlinked version of the table of contents listing\n                            chapters in the compilation that appears in the beginning pages of a printed\n                                FRUS volume, FRUS ebooks provide users with richly detailed\n                            lists of individual documents and their source notes at the beginning of each\n                            chapter and in the general table of contents accessible via the e-reader\u2019s table of\n                            contents feature.\nTip: Using full-text search.\nDescription: Like the volumes accessible on history.state.gov, FRUS ebooks are fully text-searchable. The\n                            features and behavior of the search engine depends on your e-reader device/app.\n\nProviding Feedback or Other Questions\n\nQ: How can I provide feedback or ask a\n                            question not answered here?\nA: We welcome your feedback or other questions not answered here.

The Office\u2019s historians work closely with other federal government\n                            history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the\n                            globe. The Office is directed by Dr. Stephen\n                                Randolph, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.\n\n\nWhat We Do\nThe Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and\n                            publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the\n                            Foreign Relations of the United States series.\nIn addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for\n                            Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential\n                            background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify\n                            precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on\n                            institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make\n                            decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their\n                            choices.

The series\n                            began in 1861 and now comprises more than 480 individual volumes.\nForeign Relations volumes contain documents from the Presidential libraries,\n                            Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central\n                            Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign\n                            affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in\n                            implementing U.S. foreign policy.\nLearn more about the series and view the collection at our Historical Documents page.\n\n\nOur Outreach Activities\nThe Office\u2019s public outreach activities include hosting scholarly conferences on\n                            key issues in the history of U.S. foreign policy, answering historical research\n                            questions, consulting with scholars, educators, and students, and working with\n                            high school teachers across the country to provide high-quality materials for\n                            classroom use.\n\n\nHow to Access Our Materials\nThe Office maintains a public website at history.state.gov,\n                            which provides in-depth information to the public on the history of U.S. foreign\n                            policy. In addition to a full text archive of\n                                the Foreign Relations series, the website includes valuable\n                            encyclopedic content on the history of U.S. relations\n                                with states around the world, a database of the Department\u2019s principal officers and\n                                chiefs of mission, and special tools and\n                                resources for students and teachers.\nIn keeping with the Open Government Directive\u2019s principle of transparency,\n                            participation, and collaboration as the cornerstone of an open government, the\n                            Office of the Historian has begun preparing many of its rich historical\n                            publications in a raw data format that can be accessed through data.gov.

These same essays were also enhanced with \u201ctags,\u201d or lists of the key people,\n                    places, and topics in the essay. The tags appear as links in the right sidebar of the essay\n                    and facilitate discovery of other other essays and resources, including volumes from the\n                        Foreign Relations of the United States series, on these subjects.

The first Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. \nWorld War I (1914\u20131918) and World War II (1939\u20131945) brought vastly increased global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent power.  New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, included:\n                    \nthe newly independent states,\nthe global economy,\nterrorism, and\nthe security of the American overseas presence. \n\nTo address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to:\n                    \n1,228 in 1900,\n1,968 in 1940,\n13,294 in 1960,\nand 15,751 in the year 2000.\n\nThe number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and continues to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment History\n\n\nShort History\n\nBuildings of the Department\n\nPeople\n\nBiographies of the Secretaries\n                                        of State\n\nPrincipal Officers and\n                                        Chiefs of Mission\n\n\n\nTravels\n\nTravels of the Secretary\n\nTravels of the President\n\n\n\nVisits by Foreign Leaders\n\nWorld War I and the Department\n\nU.S. Diplomatic Couriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The series, which is produced by the Department of State's Office of the Historian,\n                    began in 1861 and now comprises more than 450 individual volumes. The volumes published over\n                    the last two decades increasingly contain declassified records from all the foreign affairs\n                    agencies.\nForeign Relations volumes contain documents from Presidential libraries, Departments of State\n                    and Defense, National Security Council, Central Intelligence Agency, Agency for\n                    International Development, and other foreign affairs agencies as well as the private papers\n                    of individuals involved in formulating U.S. foreign policy. In general, the editors choose\n                    documentation that illuminates policy formulation and major aspects and repercussions of its\n                    execution. Volumes published during the last three decades have expanded the scope of the series\n                    by including documents from a wider range of government\n                    agencies, particularly those involved with intelligence activity and covert actions.\nVolumes in the series since 1952 are organized chronologically according to Presidential\n                    administrations, and geographically and topically within each subseries: 65 volumes cover\n                    the Nixon and Ford administrations (1969-1976), 32 cover\n                    the Carter administration (1977-1980), and about\n                    49 are scheduled for the Reagan\n                        administration (1981-1988). Volumes on the George H.W. Bush administration are now being\n                    researched, annotated, and prepared for\n                        publication.\nVolumes may be purchased through the U.S. Government Publishing Office (202-512-1800). Recent volumes are also available\n                        online.

While U.S. Government officials attempted to acquire territorial\n                    possessions in that region, private citizens (known as \u201cfilibusterers\u201d) also\n                    organized armed expeditions to various places in Mexico, Central America, and\n                    Cuba. Filibustering and official U.S. diplomacy were equally unsuccessful in\n                    acquiring permanent and significant territorial gains, and also tended to incite\n                    local antagonism against U.S. actions in the region.\n\nPresident Millard Fillmore\n\nAfter the territorial acquisitions of the 1840s, the idea of additional\n                    territorial expansion remained popular with the U.S. public, as did the idea of\n                    spreading republican government. Many pro-slavery Southerners sought to expand\n                    southwards, allowing for more territory where slavery could continue to grow and\n                    expand. Some even imagined the United States as a great slave-owning republic\n                    that would stretch across the Caribbean to Brazil.\nThese expansionist dreams were aided at first by a Venezuelan-born resident of\n                    Cuba, Narciso L\xf3pez, who, like some wealthy Cuban\n                    slave-owners, was wary of shaky Spanish rule over the island, and thus sought to\n                    have it annexed by the United States in order to ensure slavery\u2019s preservation\n                    in Cuba. Cuban property owners were concerned that Spain would give in to\n                    British pressure to abolish slavery in Cuba. L\xf3pez organized several failed\n                    expeditions to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule, the last resulting in his\n                    capture and execution in Havana in 1851. The American\n                    public condemned Spanish actions, especially L\xf3pez\u2019s execution without trial,\n                    but U.S. President Millard Fillmore did not issue a denunciation. Public anger\n                    against Fillmore\u2019s seemingly lukewarm support for expansion contributed to a\n                    Whig defeat in 1852.\nIn an attempt to mollify the Democratic Party\u2019s staunch proslavery wing, the new\n                    President, Franklin Pierce, appointed the proslavery\n                    politician Pierre Soul\xe9 as Minister to Spain in 1853. However, Soul\xe9 did not\n                    possess a personality well-suited to tactful diplomacy. During his appointment,\n                    Soul\xe9 disregarded his instructions to preserve Spanish sovereignty and delivered\n                    an unauthorized ultimatum to the Spanish Government regarding a seized U.S.\n                    merchant ship. Soul\xe9 also wounded the French Ambassador in a duel and began to\n                    associate with Spanish revolutionaries planning to overthrow the government. In\n                    1854, Soul\xe9 met with other U.S. Ministers to draft a document known as the\n                    Ostend Manifesto, which outlined U.S. reasons for attempting to purchase Cuba\n                    from Spain. Once the documents were publicly released, they proved embarrassing\n                    for the Pierce Administration, and U.S. Secretary of State William Marcy\n                    implied that Soul\xe9 had instigated the meeting. In the meantime, the Spanish\n                    Government began to take countermeasures against U.S. interest in Cuba. The\n                    Spanish Minister to the United States, Angel Calder\xf3n de la Barca, gathered\n                    intelligence on planned filibustering expeditions to Cuba. In Cuba, officials\n                    took steps to free slaves who had arrived on the island after 1835 and planned\n                    to organize a free black militia that would oppose any proslavery invaders.\n                    Growing antislavery sentiment in the northern United States and Spanish\n                    determination to hold on to Cuba eventually forced U.S. leaders to end attempts\n                    to acquire the island.\n\nPresident Franklin Pierce\n\nHowever, as Cuba receded from controversy, filibustering\n                    again gained attention in Nicaragua. American William Walker, who had led a\n                    failed filibustering expedition to Baja California in 1853, launched an\n                    expedition to Nicaragua in 1855. Allying himself at first\n                    with the Liberal faction in Nicaraguan politics, he eliminated his local rivals\n                    and became president in 1856. However, Walker\u2019s policies hurt British business\n                    interests, as well as those of American tycoon Cornelius\n                        Vanderbilt. Walker also alienated his Nicaraguan Liberal allies,\n                    and his regime caused growing anti-American sentiment elsewhere in Central\n                    America. These factors eventually led to Walker\u2019s downfall in 1857, despite his\n                    attempts to secure proslavery support by re-legalizing slavery in the Central\n                    American country. Walker attempted a re-conquest of Nicaragua in 1860, but was\n                    captured and executed.\nOverall, official U.S. policy toward filibusterers was one of initial lenience\n                    driven by popular support. However, U.S. officials ultimately did take steps to\n                    curb filibusterers\u2019 actions once they proved embarrassing to U.S. diplomatic\n                    relations. Despite this official ambivalence toward these filibusterers, U.S.\n                    leaders often protested the lack of due process by which foreign governments\n                    imprisoned and executed U.S. citizens involved in filibustering. Overall,\n                    filibustering and U.S. policies seem to have hindered more than helped U.S.\n                    attempts at territorial expansion in this time period. The Gadsden Purchase was\n                    the only official territorial acquisition during the 1850s. Filibustering tended\n                    to encourage local hostility to U.S. expansion and spread international\n                    resistance to growing U.S. power. U.S. expansion in the later 1850s was also\n                    hindered by domestic sectional tensions over slavery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n1830\u20131860: Diplomacy and Westward\n                    Expansion\n\nIndian Treaties and the Removal Act of 1830\n\nThe Amistad Case, 1839\n\nThe Opening to China Part I: the First Opium War, the United States, and the\n                    Treaty of Wangxia, 1839\u20131844\n\nWebster-Ashburton Treaty, 1842\n\nThe Oregon Territory, 1846\n\nThe Annexation of Texas, the Mexican-American War, and the Treaty of\n                    Guadalupe-Hidalgo, 1845\u20131848\n\nFounding of Liberia, 1847\n\n United States Maritime Expansion across the Pacific during the 19th\n                    Century\n\nGadsden Purchase, 1853\u20131854\n\nThe United States and the Opening to Japan, 1853\n\nThe Opening to China Part II: the Second Opium War, the United States, and the\n                    Treaty of Tianjin, 1857\u20131859\n\nTerritorial Expansion, Filibustering, and U.S. Interest in Central America and\n                    Cuba, 1849\u20131861\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The three main\n                    concepts of the doctrine\u2014separate spheres of influence for the Americas and\n                    Europe, non-colonization, and non-intervention\u2014were designed to signify a clear\n                    break between the New World and the autocratic realm of Europe. Monroe\u2019s\n                    administration forewarned the imperial European powers against interfering in\n                    the affairs of the newly independent Latin American states or potential United\n                    States territories. While Americans generally objected to European colonies in\n                    the New World, they also desired to increase United States influence and trading\n                    ties throughout the region to their south. European mercantilism posed the\n                    greatest obstacle to economic expansion. In particular, Americans feared that\n                    Spain and France might reassert colonialism over the Latin American peoples who\n                    had just overthrown European rule. Signs that Russia was expanding its presence\n                    southward from Alaska toward the Oregon Territory were also disconcerting.\nFor their part, the British also had a strong interest in ensuring the demise of\n                    Spanish colonialism, with all the trade restrictions mercantilism imposed.\n                    Earlier in 1823 British Foreign Minister George Canning suggested to Americans\n                    that two nations issue a joint declaration to deter any other power from\n                    intervening in Central and South America. Secretary of State John Quincy\n                    Adams, however, vigorously opposed cooperation with Great Britain,\n                    contending that a statement of bilateral nature could limit United States\n                    expansion in the future. He also argued that the British were not committed to\n                    recognizing the Latin American republics and must have had imperial motivations\n                    themselves.\n\nBritish Foreign Minister George Canning\n\nThe bilateral statement proposed by the British thereby became a unilateral\n                    declaration by the United States. As Monroe stated: \u201cThe American\n                        continents \u2026 are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future\n                        colonization by any European powers.\u201d Monroe outlined two separate\n                    spheres of influence: the Americas and Europe. The independent lands of the\n                    Western Hemisphere would be solely the United States\u2019 domain. In exchange, the\n                    United States pledged to avoid involvement in the political affairs of Europe,\n                    such as the ongoing Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire, and\n                    not to interfere in the existing European colonies already in the Americas.\nBy the mid-1800s, Monroe\u2019s declaration, combined with ideas of Manifest Destiny,\n                    provided precedent and support for U.S. expansion on the American continent. In\n                    the late 1800s, U.S. economic and military power enabled it to enforce the\n                    Monroe Doctrine. The doctrine\u2019s greatest extension came with Theodore\n                        Roosevelt\u2019s Corollary, which inverted the original meaning of the\n                    doctrine and came to justify unilateral U.S. intervention in Latin America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n1801\u20131829: Securing the Republic\n\nBarbary Wars, 1801\u20131805 and 1815\u20131816\n\nNapoleonic Wars and the United States, 1803\u20131815\n\nLouisiana Purchase, 1803\n\nWar of 1812\u20131815\n\nRush-Bagot Pact, 1817 and Convention of 1818\n\nAcquisition of Florida: Treaty of Adams-Onis (1819)\n                    and Transcontinental Treaty (1821)\n\nMonroe Doctrine, 1823\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Many leaders were also angry\n                    that the United States had concluded the Jay Treaty with Great Britain in 1794.\n                    Consequently, in 1796 French leaders decided to issue an order allowing for the\n                    seizure of American merchant ships, carefully timed to catch as many as possible\n                    by surprise. President John Adams dispatched three U.S. envoys to restore\n                    harmony between the United States and France\u2014Elbridge\n                    Gerry, Charles\n                        Cotesworth Pinckney, and John\n                        Marshall.\n\n\nJohn Marshall\n\nThese commissioners, like others of the Adams administration, viewed France as a\n                    center of decadence and intrigue and the rampant intrigue and factions of the\n                    Directory made it difficult for the Americans to accomplish their mission. Upon\n                    arriving in France, Gerry, Pinckney and Marshall found that they were unable to\n                    formally meet with the Foreign Minister, the Marquis de\n                        Talleyrand. The U.S. envoys were instead approached by several\n                    intermediaries, Nicholas Hubbard (later W,) Jean Hottinguer (X), Pierre Bellamy\n                    (Y), and Lucien Hauteval (Z.) Also involved with these negotiations was the\n                    playwright Pierre Beaumarchais, who had been involved in funneling French aid to\n                    the United States during the American Revolution. These French intermediaries\n                    stated that Talleyrand would be willing to meet with the Americans and come to\n                    an agreement if several conditions were to be satisfied. The French demanded\n                    that the United States provide France with a low-interest loan, assume and pay\n                    American merchant claims against the French, and lastly pay a substantial bribe\n                    to Talleyrand. The U.S. envoys were shocked, and also skeptical that any\n                    concessions would bring about substantial changes in French policy.\n\nMarquis de Talleyrand\n\nTalleyrand\u2019s strategy was mainly one of delay. He intended to end attacks on U.S.\n                    merchant shipping, but wanted first to increase his personal wealth, strengthen\n                    his political position within the Directory government, and ensure that he would\n                    deal only with Elbridge Gerry, the American commissioner who seemed most\n                    friendly to French interests. Talleyrand\u2019s intermediaries were also interested\n                    in preserving peace with the United States as many of them had investments in\n                    U.S. businesses. However, as French military victories in Europe increased\n                    French power, the French changed the loan terms and threatened an invasion of\n                    the United States if the U.S. envoys did not capitulate. When the U.S. envoys\n                    proved unwilling to accede to French demands, Talleyrand eventually met with\n                    them formally, and dropped most of his requirements, but did not agree to end\n                    the seizures of American ships. Pinckney and Marshall made preparations to leave\n                    France, while Gerry intended to stay in the hopes of averting a war.\nIn the meantime, the envoys\u2019 dispatches reached the United States. President\n                    Adams prepared for war, and pro-war Federalists pushed Congress to support him.\n                    Leaders of the Democratic-Republican party were suspicious of Adams\u2019 motives and\n                    demanded that he publicly release the diplomatic correspondence describing the\n                    negotiations in France. Adams, knowing its contents, obliged them and released\n                    the correspondence, but replaced the names of the French intermediaries with the\n                    letters W, X, Y, and Z.\nThereafter Adams continued preparations for war, but did not venture to openly\n                    declare war. Talleyrand, realizing his blunder, attempted to restore relations,\n                    and Congress approved a commission to negotiate an agreement with the French\n                    government. In the meantime, the U.S. Navy began to fight the French in the\n                    Caribbean, while offering support to Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture in Haiti. In 1799,\n                    Congress also passed the Logan Act in response to the visit of a pacifist\n                    Quaker, George Logan, who conducted negotiations with Talleyrand as a private\n                    citizen and returned to the United States announcing Talleyrand\u2019s peaceful\n                    intentions. The Logan Act criminalized unauthorized diplomatic negotiations.\nIn the meantime peace negotiations proceeded in France. Napoleon had come to\n                    power, and was seeking to re-obtain Louisiana from Spain. Consequently,\n                    Talleyrand, who remained as Foreign Minister, wanted to prevent further\n                    hostility with the United States. For their part, the British had delighted in\n                    the anti-French uproar in the United States and moved to assist the Americans\n                    against a common foe, revolutionary France. However, President Adams ultimately\n                    wanted to avoid a major war, confident that had France wanted war it would have\n                    responded to American attacks on French ships. Talleyrand feared that limited\n                    hostilities with the United States might escalate into a full-scale war and let\n                    it be known that he would accept a new American diplomatic representative. Adams\n                    nominated a new representative to France despite public and Federalist\n                    disappointment that there would be no war, but conceded to Federalist demands\n                    and expanded the single nomination into a commission of three.\nThe negotiators chose to annul the 1778 Treaty of Alliance, and instead\n                    negotiated a new agreement based on the 1776 Model Treaty\u2014this resulted in the\n                    Convention of 1800. Since the new agreement made no provisions for compensation\n                    for the seizure of U.S. merchant ships, the Senate did not ratify a finalized\n                    version of the treaty until December 18, 1801. The Convention of 1800 terminated\n                    the only formal treaty of alliance of the United States. It would be nearly a\n                    century and a half before the United States entered into another formal\n                    alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n1784\u20131800: The Diplomacy of the Early\n                    Republic\n\nU.S. Debt and Foreign Loans, 1775\u20131795\n\nConstitutional Convention and Ratification, 1787\u20131789\n\nThe United States and the French Revolution, 1789\u20131799\n\nThe United States and the Haitian Revolution, 1791\u20131804\n\nThe Citizen Gen\xeat Affair, 1793\u20131794\n\nJohn Jay\u2019s Treaty, 1794\u201395\n\nTreaty of San Lorenzo/ Pinckney\u2019s Treaty, 1795\n\nWashington\u2019s Farewell Address, 1796\n\nThe XYZ Affair and the Quasi-War with France, 1798\u20131800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Franklin insisted on British recognition of\n                    American independence and refused to consider a peace separate from France,\n                    America\u2019s staunch ally. Franklin did agree, however, to negotiations with the\n                    British for an end to the war. Joined by peace commissioners John Adams and John\n                    Jay, Franklin engaged the British in formal negotiations beginning on September\n                    27, 1782.\n\nAmerican Negotiations of the Peace of Paris\n\nAlthough Franklin demanded the cessation of Canada to an independent America, he\n                    knew that the British Government of Lord Shelburne, opposed\n                    to American independence, was unprepared to accept that offer. Two months of\n                    hard bargaining resulted in a preliminary articles of peace in which the British\n                    accepted American independence and boundaries, resolved the difficult issues of\n                    fishing rights on the Newfoundland banks and prewar debts owed British\n                    creditors, promised restitution of property lost during the war by Americans\n                    loyal to the British cause, and provided for the evacuation of British forces\n                    from the thirteen states. The preliminary articles signed in Paris on November\n                    30, 1782, were only effective when Britain and France signed a similar treaty,\n                    which French Foreign Minister Vergennes quickly negotiated.\n                    France signed preliminary articles of peace with Great Britain on January 20,\n                    1783, followed by a formal peace of Paris signed on September 3, 1783.\nThe illustration above, a copy of a sketch by the studio of Benjamin\n                        West, shows the American negotiators of the Peace of Paris. The\n                    sketch remains incomplete because British negotiators chose not to sit for their\n                    half of the portrait: it serves as a powerful symbol of the division between\n                    Great Britain and its former American colonies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n1776\u20131783: Diplomacy and the American\n                    Revolution\n\nContinental Congress, 1774\u20131781\n\nSecret Committee of Correspondence/ Committee for Foreign Affairs, 1775\u20131777\n\nThe Declaration of Independence, 1776\n\nThe Model Treaty, 1776\n\nFrench Alliance, French Assistance, and European Diplomacy during the American\n                    Revolution, 1778\u20131782\n\nBenjamin Franklin: First American Diplomat, 1776\u20131785\n\nArticles of Confederation, 1777\u20131781\n\nTreaty of Paris, 1783\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Conflicts arose from\n                    the inability of British officials to balance the interests of colonists and\n                    Indians, which led to colonial dissatisfaction with imperial rule and,\n                    ultimately, to the causes of the American Revolution.\n\nThe Proclamation Line of 1763\u2014between the red colored colonies and the\n                        pink territories\n\nThe Treaty of Paris of 1763 that ended the Seven Years\u2019 War provided Great\n                    Britain with enormous territorial gains. Under the treaty, Canada and the entire\n                    present-day United States east of the Mississippi came under British control.\n                    With the official end of the war, Anglo-American colonists began to pour over\n                    the Appalachian Mountains in search of land. As the native population had made\n                    no land cessions, many of these settlers had no official claim to the land. In\n                    many cases, the land was claimed by private land companies, in which the\n                    Virginia elite had invested heavily in an attempt to diversify their holdings\n                    outside of the volatile tobacco market. Thus, they had an interest in pressing\n                    the British Government to address ensuing tensions.\nThe settlement of the lands west of the Appalachians brought inevitable tension\n                    and conflict between settlers and indigenous peoples. British military officials\n                    attempted to halt settlement, but eager settlers and land speculators ignored\n                    their directives. With the military unwilling to forcibly remove settlers from\n                    the lands, Anglo-American colonists continued to migrate west and lay claim\n                    these lands.\nBritish officials made the situation worse by alienating American Indians who had\n                    been allied with France during the Seven Years\u2019 War. The French Government had\n                    devoted significant resources to furnishing gifts to their Indian allies. When\n                    British forces arrived to take over former French forts, they halted the\n                    gift-giving practice, not realizing that doing so undercut the authority of any\n                    pro-British leaders within indigenous communities and antagonized the Indian\n                    leaders.\nIn response to British actions and western settlement, the leader of the Ottawa\n                    tribe, Pontiac, sent messages encoded in wampum belts to other communities\n                    throughout the present-day Midwest to coordinate an attack on British forts.\n                    Unaware of the depth of Indian anger and resentment, British forces were caught\n                    largely by surprise and lost all their western forts except for Fort Pitt and\n                    Detroit, where British military officials were tipped off and, therefore, able\n                    to prevent seizure.\nWhen news of the rebellion reached London, the government decided to put into\n                    action a plan for creating a western Indian reserve, and produced the Royal\n                    Proclamation of 1763, which forbid colonial settlement beyond the line of the\n                    Appalachian Mountains. The act also created the provinces of Quebec, West\n                    Florida, and East Florida. The proclamation was largely ineffective in\n                    preventing western settlement, and served only to anger both settlers and the\n                    political elite who had invested in western land speculation.\nWar with the Indian tribes continued from 1764 into 1766. British officials\n                    managed to negotiate peace with the Senecas in the Niagara region and with\n                    Indians in the upper Ohio River valley, and, in 1766, Pontiac agreed to a formal\n                    treaty signed at Fort Ontario on July 25. Pontiac\u2019s War is diplomatically\n                    significant because it was the first war between European settlers and American\n                    Indians where Indians had united broadly across tribal lines.\nAfter the end of Pontiac\u2019s rebellion, regulation of the western frontier was not\n                    significantly altered until Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774. With this\n                    piece of legislation, the British intended to preempt any dissatisfaction among\n                    the French Canadian population by restoring French civil law and allowing\n                    Catholics to hold office. It also imposed direct crown rule on Quebec and\n                    extended Quebec\u2019s borders south to the Ohio River.\nThe Quebec Act angered the Virginia elite, since most of the western lands they\n                    claimed were now officially part of Quebec or in the Indian reserve. The act,\n                    which Parliament passed at the same time as legislation placing Massachusetts\n                    under crown control, also fueled resentment among Calvinist New Englanders, who\n                    saw in its autocratic, pro-Catholic provisions further evidence of an imperial\n                    conspiracy against colonial liberties.\nWhen the American Revolution began in 1774, tensions between settlers and Indians\n                    became a part of the conflict. The Continental Congress\u2019s attempts to secure\n                    Indian alliances largely failed, as most Indians saw the British military as the\n                    lesser of two evils in their struggle against settlers\u2019 encroachments upon their\n                    land. However, the Oneida and Tuscarora Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy did\n                    side with the colonists.\nThe ultimate effect of British frontier policy was to unite frontiersmen,\n                    Virginia land speculators, and New Englanders against unpopular British\n                    policies.

H.W. Bush visiting the Troops during the First Gulf\n                        War\n\nWhen Saddam Hussein invaded his small, oil-rich neighbor in the summer of\n                        1990, the Department faced its first full-scale post-Cold War international\n                        crisis. Bush\u2019s foreign policy team forged an unprecedented international\n                        coalition consisting of the NATO allies and the Middle Eastern countries of\n                            Saudi Arabia, Syria, and\n                            Egypt to oppose Iraqi aggression. Although\n                            Russia did not commit troops, it joined the\n                        United States in condemning Iraq, its long-time client state. The Department\n                        of State orchestrated the diplomacy for this grand coalition\u2019s effective air\n                        campaign in January 1991, which was followed by \u201cOperation Desert Storm,\u201d a\n                        100-hour land war, which expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait. \nDuring the Gulf crisis, Secretary of State Baker relied heavily on two\n                        men\u2014John Bolton, Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization\n                        Affairs, who played a significant role in coordinating relations with the\n                        United Nations, and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Robert\n                        Kimmitt, who was Baker\u2019s day-to-day crisis manager. One innovation that\n                        greatly facilitated decision-making during the Gulf War was the use of\n                        teleconferences, which saved many hours of travel time. Instead, Baker and\n                        others could communicate and display charts through cameras and television\n                        screens.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs,\n                            John Bolton\n\nAfter the success in Kuwait, President Bush paid special tribute to the\n                        Foreign Service officers who labor in relative obscurity until they are\n                        caught up in a dangerous conflict or become the victims of international\n                        terrorism. President Bush made a special visit to the Department of State to\n                        honor 33 employees for their service at our embassies in Baghdad and Kuwait,\n                        which included finding food and supplies for trapped Americans in those\n                        countries and helping children to safe havens after fighting erupted.\n                        Acknowledging the peril most Americans never see, Bush said, \u201cI know that\n                        often your jobs are not comfortable or safe.\u201d \nIraq was not the only trouble spot in the Middle East during Bush\u2019s four\n                        years in office. The perennial tension between Israel and its Arab neighbors\n                        continued to test the expertise of the many U.S. ambassadors and area\n                        experts. Baker\u2019s personal involvement, reflected in numerous trips to the\n                        region, helped bring about the first face-to-face talks between Israel and\n                        all of its Arab neighbors in Madrid, beginning in October 1991.

From the beginning of Baker\u2019s tenure until August\n                        23, 1992, when he resigned to become White House Chief of Staff, he made 217\n                        trips abroad.\nLawrence\n                            Eagleburger, who succeeded Baker, became the first Foreign Service\n                        officer to serve as Secretary of State. During a 27-year government career,\n                        Eagleburger had been a staffer for Kissinger\u2019s National Security Council,\n                        and held numerous senior positions at the Department of State, including\n                        Under Secretary for Political Affairs, Deputy Under Secretary for\n                        Management, and Assistant Secretary for European Affairs. Eagleburger's\n                        appointment reflected Bush\u2019s deep respect for the Foreign Service. Bush\n                        compiled an impressive record of nominating career officers to\n                        ambassadorships (72 percent), one of the best records for all Presidents in\n                        the post-1945 era.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nFoundations of Foreign Affairs, 1775-1823\n\n\nThe Expansionist Years, 1823-1867\n\n\nRise to World Power, 1867-1913\n\n\nThe Challenge of Global Conflict, 1913-1945\n\n\nContainment and Cold War, 1945-1961\n\n\nSuperpowers Collide, 1961-1981\n\n\nThe End of the Cold War, 1981-1992\n\nThe First Gulf War\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-23344799-1']);\n          _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'history.state.gov']);\n          _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In the People\u2019s Republic of\n                            China, tanks and troops attacked pro-democracy demonstrators\n                        in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, effectively suppressing the movement.\n                        Media coverage of the suppression made a powerful impression, as nations\n                        around the world realized that China was not prepared to follow the\n                            Soviet Union and Eastern\n                        Europe and allow its people more freedom. The United States\n                        joined the protest of many other nations by imposing economic sanctions and\n                        condemning the suppression and killing of the pro-democracy demonstrators. \n\n"The Goddess of Democracy" erected in Tiananmen Square during the\n                            protest.\n\nIn an effort to improve U.S. relations with China, Bush sent Deputy Secretary\n                        of State Lawrence Eagleburger and National Security Adviser Brent\n                        Scowcroft on a secret trip to China in July 1989. When word of their visit\n                        became public several months later, the President was criticized for\n                        pursuing \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with the Chinese Communist government so\n                        soon after the Tiananmen Square killings and his announcement of a U.S. ban\n                        on all high-level talks between the two countries. \nUnlike the serious human rights abuses in China, the changes taking place in\n                        South Africa signaled a peaceful end to the practice of apartheid. Secretary\n                        Baker described U.S. policy as a \u201cclassic carrot-and-stick strategy,\u201d in\n                        which the Department of State issued threats of continued sanctions as well\n                        as invitations to the United States to both black and white South African\n                        leaders as incentives to end apartheid. The Department\u2019s African Bureau took\n                        the lead. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen met\n                        privately with South African President F.W. de Klerk to inquire whether he\n                        was prepared to end apartheid.\n\nSouth African President, F.W. de Klerk\n\nBy late 1989, de Klerk had desegregated many public places, released numerous\n                        African National Congress (ANC) and other anti-apartheid political\n                        prisoners, and discussed black-white power sharing. A few months later, de\n                        Klerk released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years of incarceration.\n                        Mandela proved to be a potent symbol of national healing, respected by most\n                        blacks and whites in South Africa. Recognizing that the government was on a\n                        course toward a nonracial, multiparty democracy, the ANC soon ended its\n                        policy of armed struggle against the South African Government.\nThe Department of State\u2019s African Bureau also played a critical role in\n                        bringing about the end of the proxy war in Angola between the pro-Soviet and\n                        pro-U.S. factions. In the spring of 1991, Cohen conducted negotiations with\n                        the Soviets that ended more than 20 years of support for guerrilla warfare\n                        between contending groups, although peace remained elusive in that\n                        war-ravaged country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nFoundations of Foreign Affairs, 1775-1823\n\n\nThe Expansionist Years, 1823-1867\n\n\nRise to World Power, 1867-1913\n\n\nThe Challenge of Global Conflict, 1913-1945\n\n\nContainment and Cold War, 1945-1961\n\n\nSuperpowers Collide, 1961-1981\n\n\nThe End of the Cold War, 1981-1992\n\nNew Global Problems Emerge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\nHome\n\nSearch\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nTopics\nHistorical Documents\n\nDepartment History\n\nCountries\n\nMilestones of U.S. Foreign Relations\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nImprint\nPrivacy Notice\n\nExternal Link Policy\n\nCopyright Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Historian, Bureau of Public AffairsUnited States Department of State\n\nhistory@state.gov\n\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nFax: 202-955-0268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n          _gaq.push([\'_setAccount\', \'UA-23344799-1\']);\n          _gaq.push([\'_setDomainName\', \'history.state.gov\']);\n          _gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\']);\n\n          (function() {{\n              var ga = document.createElement(\'script\'); ga.type = \'text/javascript\'; ga.async = true;\n              ga.src = (\'https:\' == document.location.protocol ? \'https://ssl\' : \'http://www\') + \'.google-analytics.com/ga.js\';\n              var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\'script\')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);\n          }})();\n        \n\n',

We have taken into account all the communications made to us by\n                            President Nixon. We have had quite a few over the past few months, and\n                            we have tried to take them all into account, particularly those in the\n                            most recent period.\n[The General-Secretary then read the Soviet note on ABM\u2019s:]2\n\n\u201cIt is recognized as expedient to limit ABM systems in the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. to\n                            covering the capitals and to one area each for the location of\n                            land-based ICBM silo launchers.\n\u201cThe location of ABM facilities for the\n                            covering of the capitals would be limited to an area in the form of a\n                            circle with a radius of 150 km whose center would be within the limits\n                            of the capital.\u201d\nThis is a reflection of your proposal to us.3\n\nKissinger: One member of our\n                            delegation is an adviser to your delegation.[Page 775]\nBrezhnev: [resumes reading ABM note:] \u201cThe location of ABM facilities for covering land-based\n                                ICBM silo launchers would be\n                            limited to an area in the form of a circle with a radius of 150 km whose\n                            center for the United States would be in the area of location of ICBM launchers where the deployment of\n                                ABM facilities is most\n                            advanced.\u201d\nThis also reflects your proposal.\n\u201cThe quantity of ABMs and their launchers\n                            for each side should not exceed 100 units for covering the capitals and\n                            100 units for covering land-based ICBM\n                            silo launchers.\u201d\nThat, too, reflects your proposal.\nSo now you have something to take back, a proposal from your confidential\n                            channel.\nKissinger: The only one which does\n                            not reflect our official thinking, but that of a member of our\n                            delegation, is the 150 km radius.\nMr. General-Secretary, let me say this is a constructive approach. I will\n                            reserve comment until I hear what you say about submarines.\nBrezhnev: Nothing.\nKissinger: Nothing.\nBrezhnev: Be patient. What can I\n                            say about them? They travel under water, we can\u2019t see them, they\u2019re\n                            silent\u2014\nGromyko: [in English] Puzzle,\n                            puzzle!\nKissinger: You do have something\n                            on submarines?\nGromyko: You can\u2019t read it before\n                            Sukhodrev!\n[Sukhodrev then reads the text of the note on submarines:]\n\u201cWe have thoroughly considered the state of affairs at the strategic arms\n                            limitation talks taking into account the considerations expressed by the\n                                US side through the confidential\n                            channel, relating to the freeze on ballistic-missile carrying\n                            submarines.\n\u201cIn this connection we believe it appropriate to state the following:\n\u201c1. The question of the freeze on the number of modern ballistic-missile\n                            carrying submarines and the total number of launchers thereon is of very\n                            significant importance.\n\u201cBallistic-missile carrying submarines occupy a special place in the\n                            composition of strategic offensive weapons and their consideration\n                            should not overlook differences in the geographies of the sides, the\n                            ballistic-missile carrying submarines at the disposal of the USNATO allies and the US forward submarine bases.\n\u201cAs is known, that offers important strategic advantages to the American\n                            side, and under these conditions the number of submarines and ballistic\n                            missiles thereon at the disposal of the sides cannot be the same.\n\u201c2. In order to bring about relaxation of international tensions,\n                            normalization of relations between our two countries and cessation of\n                                [Page 776]the strategic arms race we\n                            agree to consider the question of including ballistic-missile carrying\n                            submarines in the suggested freeze agreement provided, naturally, that\n                            there should be established for the sides appropriate limits for such\n                            systems taking into account the considerations set forth above.\n\u201cThe Soviet Union would agree that the US\n                            and their NATO allies should have, for\n                            the period of the freeze agreement, up to 50 modern submarines with the\n                            total number of ballistic missile launchers thereon of up to 800,\n                            including 41 submarines with 656 ballistic missile launchers thereon at\n                            the disposal of the United States. Over that period the Soviet Union\n                            could have 62 modern submarines with the total number of ballistic\n                            missile launchers thereon of no more than 950.\n\u201cIt is understood that over that period the sides will reduce the number\n                            of land-based ICBMs through dismantling\n                            older launchers. The sides would also be entitled to modernize and\n                            replace older submarines by new submarines but without increasing in the\n                            process the above-mentioned number of modern submarines and ballistic\n                            missile launchers thereon.\n\u201cHowever, since the above proposal would only be a partial compensation\n                            for the strategic disbalance in the location of missile carrying nuclear\n                            submarines of the sides, the Soviet side proceeds from the premise that\n                            the whole of this problem\u2014and primarily the issue of dismantling US missile submarine bases outside the\n                            territory of the United States, should be appropriately resolved in the\n                            course of subsequent negotiations.\n\u201cIf over the period of the Interim agreement the USNATO allies increase the number of\n                            ballistic-missile carrying submarines to the excess of those operational\n                            or under construction, the Soviet Union reserves the right to the\n                            corresponding increase in such submarines.\n\u201c3. Taking into account the proposals of the US side the Soviet Union could agree to include in the\n                            suggested freeze agreement the obligation not to start, in addition to\n                                ICBM silo launchers, new\n                            construction of fixed soft land-based ICBM launchers as well.\n\u201c4. Moscow believes it possible to have the period of the Interim freeze\n                            agreement\u20145 years.\n\u201c5. Given understanding in principle on such an approach we would be\n                            prepared to give necessary instructions to the Soviet delegation in\n                            Helsinki to discuss practical matters related to the final elaboration\n                            of the corresponding articles of the Interim agreement on certain\n                            measures with respect to strategic offensive armaments having in mind\n                            that this Agreement together with the Treaty on the limitation of ABM systems would be signed during the\n                            forthcoming meeting in Moscow.\u201d[Page 777]\nBrezhnev: I think that is a very\n                            constructive proposal and it is in keeping with the spirit of all those\n                            communications you made through Ambassador Dobrynin. I would think President Nixon should think it\n                            very constructive. Apart from the constructive nature of our proposals,\n                            that paper is another sign of the spirit with which we approach the\n                            Summit meeting.\nKissinger: If the\n                            General-Secretary says as little on Vietnam as he said on submarines, we\n                            will make enormous progress today.\nBrezhnev: I\u2019d have been pleased to\n                            say less on Vietnam, but Dr. Kissinger took so much time.\nKissinger: That was meant as a\n                            compliment. You had said you\u2019d say nothing on submarines.\nIt\u2019s a very constructive approach. I recognize that it incorporates many\n                            of the points we made in the confidential channel. It is a serious\n                            effort to address many of our concerns.\nMay I ask a practical question, simply for my understanding?\nWhen you say, \u201cOver the period the sides will reduce the number of\n                            land-based ICBMs,\u201d does this mean you\n                            accept the obligation I mentioned to Dobrynin to dismantle older land-based missiles once we\n                            grant you the right to build more submarines?\nBrezhnev: That is what is implied.\n                            We have accepted that principle. We won\u2019t build new ones to replace the\n                            ones removed. We will build submarines according to the terms allowed,\n                            and we are prepared to inform you of the exact month and date we will\n                            dismantle the ICBM facilities.\nKissinger: We will have a problem\n                            in explaining to our Congress why you have a greater number of missiles\n                            in both categories. If we have an understanding that you will dismantle\n                            some of the older missiles, we will instruct our delegation to work out\n                            the precise numbers. Semenov can\n                            work this out with our delegation. We needn\u2019t do it here, at this\n                            level.\nGromyko: We will instruct\n                            accordingly.\nBrezhnev: It is very easy. Of\n                            course we will be dismantling.\nKissinger: I only want to fix this\n                            so we can make this instruction to our delegation and make this part of\n                            the negotiation.\nBrezhnev: We will give similar\n                            instructions.\nKissinger: No problem. But I have\n                            one other point. It is difficult for us to discuss limitations on\n                            British and French submarines. It would be easier if you make a\n                            unilateral declaration. We agree to 41, then if the British and French\n                            build more than 9 and if the total number reaches more than 50, then you\n                            can respond accordingly. This will be easier, because we have no right\n                            to tell the British and French what to do. You will make unilateral\n                            deal. We have no right to negotiate the total number.[Page 778]\nBrezhnev: Of course. We shall\n                            certainly give thought to a unilateral declaration. But the figures are\n                            agreed.\nKissinger: The figures are agreed.\n                            There is no problem about figures. I will show you what a bad diplomat I\n                            am. Gromyko wouldn\u2019t do this, but\n                            I think the submarine matter is acceptable in principle.\nBrezhnev: This shows what a strong\n                            diplomat you are. I agree our Foreign Ministry would never do that, but\n                            that\u2019s an example of how bad it is.\nGromyko: It\u2019s your advantage. I\n                            would never have said this outright. I would have waited at least three\n                            minutes.\nBrezhnev: I don\u2019t want to raise\n                            the question at this time, but I do want to mention the serious matter\n                            of the U.S. military bases ringing the\n                            Soviet Union. This relates to your air force and intermediate range\n                            missiles.\nSonnenfeldt: We have no IRBM\u2019s.\nKissinger: We are going to ground\n                                Sonnenfeldt.\nBrezhnev: We mean forward-based\n                            missiles. It doesn\u2019t make any difference what kind of rocket you die\n                            from.\nKissinger: Sonnenfeldt is right. We have no\n                            forward-based missiles that can reach the USSR, but I understand the General-Secretary\u2019s point.\nBrezhnev: Of course it\u2019s useless\n                            to deploy intermediate range missiles in the U.S., so you deploy them abroad.\nKissinger: We have airplanes that\n                            can reach the USSR. As it happens, we\n                            have no missiles in Europe that can reach the USSR, but we have airplanes that can. But we understand the\n                            General-Secretary\u2019s point and we take it seriously.\nBrezhnev: As we see it, this could\n                            be the start of an important future process. It could be the start of\n                            the strengthening of confidence; this should be followed by further\n                            measure of goodwill to strengthen normal relations between our two\n                            countries.\nKissinger: Agreed.\nBrezhnev: . . . measures that\n                            would be in no way prejudicial to obligations each of us has to other\n                            countries, and would be at the same time encouraging to the Allies of us\n                            both. Therein lies the greatness and noble purpose of our two\n                            countries.\nKissinger: This attitude can be a\n                            principal result of the Summit.\nBrezhnev: These are indeed\n                            problems of great importance. First, the statement of principles\n                                yesterday,4 then this,\u2014all this\n                            carries great [Page 779]significance. It\n                            will last the commentators and analysts about 2 years, until the next\n                            Summit. I could write a good commentary. I could write a good article\n                            for the U.S. press. How much do you pay\n                            for a good article?\nKissinger: My only hope is that\n                            the next meeting is sooner than 2 years, and I hope the General\n                            Secretary can visit us next year.\nBrezhnev: I don\u2019t think I have an\n                            invitation or visa yet.\nKissinger: You will have an\n                            invitation when President Nixon comes here. We hope to have that in the\n                            final communiqu\xe9.\nBrezhnev: Thank you. In the coming\n                            4 years, the United States and Soviet Union should take even more\n                            important steps to increase the spirit of good will.\nKissinger: As for ABMs, Mr. General Secretary, we have\n                            proposed using 2 ICBM fields, rather\n                            than Washington and 1 ICBM field, but I\n                            consider your proposal constructive.\nBrezhnev: Then you said 2 and\n                            2.\nKissinger: I will have to discuss\n                            this in Washington, but we will do so in very positive attitude.\nBrezhnev: Mr. Kissinger\u2014I would not want this on the\n                            record\u2014this has the advantage for you, which your military are aware of,\n                            that yours covers more ICBM\u2019s than our\n                            does.\nKissinger: I understand, but not\n                            necessarily if they are 150 km radius. It depends on where you put your\n                            fields.\nBrezhnev: This won\u2019t be the case.\n                            The area will be clearly defined. It is a secret now, but not for long.\n                            Your military will photograph it anyway.\nKissinger: If you can give me\n                            informally some idea of the number of ICBMs you will put in this field, it would help persuade\n                            some of my people. You don\u2019t have to tell me the field, just an idea of\n                            the number, to tell the President.\nBrezhnev: I will tell you that\n                            later.\nKissinger: It\u2019s just for the\n                            President.\nBrezhnev: But I can say beforehand\n                            that we will have fewer than you have.\nKissinger: May I make a\n                            suggestion?\nBrezhnev: It is not to be made\n                            public. Because it is really to your advantage and it would be bad if it\n                            came out.\nKissinger: I must be honest with\n                            you. Anything in the White House we can keep totally secret. Once it\n                            leaves the White House, as your Ambassador can tell you, I can\u2019t\n                            completely control it.\nBrezhnev: That\u2019s why I say I\n                            should have invited Rogers in the\n                            first place![Page 780]\nKissinger: You would have gotten\n                            more publicity. Therefore what you tell me here will not become public.\n                            Once agreement is completed, I can\u2019t guarantee that numbers won\u2019t become\n                            public, but what the General Secretary says here will not.\nBrezhnev: In nature of\n                            speculation, but not officially.\nKissinger: But once we have a\n                            treaty, our people will have to testify before Congressional committees.\n                            We will try to control it, but the testimony will only happen several\n                            months after an agreement.\nBrezhnev: That\u2019s a procedural\n                            matter. If we agree on this principle, procedural matters won\u2019t be a\n                            problem.\nKissinger: The submarine matter is\n                            certainly acceptable. The ABM matter I\n                            will have to discuss in Washington but it is certainly in the direction.\n                            . . .\nBrezhnev: I feel it incorporates\n                            your latest suggestion and incorporates the principle of equality, and I\n                            don\u2019t foresee changes.\nKissinger: I don\u2019t see any\n                            problems. Let me suggest the following procedure. I will take this up\n                            with the President as soon as I return Monday or Tuesday.5 We\u2019ll then call back our\n                            negotiator from Helsinki and simultaneously get together with our\n                            military people. All of this will take about a week. We\u2019ll then instruct\n                            our negotiator. If you can send your Ambassador back. . . . If in the\n                            meantime Semenov can be kept under\n                            restraint so he doesn\u2019t reveal this, it would speed this matter.\nBrezhnev: We have given him\n                            instructions. But if you think this is easier, we can send him a\n                            telegram to keep it back for a time.\nKissinger: Let me think about\n                            it.\nBrezhnev: We have enough time to\n                            cable him to hold up.\nKissinger: When will he propose\n                            it? Monday?\nGromyko: At his discretion. He met\n                            with Smith yesterday and said\n                            nothing.\nKissinger: He hinted at it.\nBrezhnev: On submarines, Semenov knows nothing.\nKissinger: Let him propose it. Let\n                            me on second thought talk to the President. I\u2019ll tell Vorontsov.\nGromyko: We\u2019ll hold Semenov up.\nBrezhnev: We have a closed phone\n                            link, so we will phone him immediately.\n[Aide goes out to do so.][Page 781]\nKissinger: How should we do it in\n                            Helsinki? Should they conclude the whole thing in Helsinki, or should we\n                            leave something for the Summit? We can settle certain things privately\n                            but not in Helsinki.\nBrezhnev: The signing should be on\n                            a high level. The final decision and signing should be at the Summit\n                            level.\nKissinger: The signing and final\n                            decisions should be at the highest level, yes.\nGromyko: Since this matter relates\n                            to a text, it may be best for our delegations to finalize as much as is\n                            possible. Because it is a text, the lawyers should look at it. If all is\n                            done here, there is a risk of not having enough time. But the final\n                            decision and signing should be here.\nKissinger: I agree with the\n                            Foreign Minister that perhaps we should pick some issues, perhaps one or\n                            two\u2014I don\u2019t want to take the time of the General Secretary on this\u2014on\n                            which the delegations should write the text, but then, the President and\n                            the General Secretary can settle them here.\nGromyko: Deliberately you\n                            mean?\nKissinger: Yes.\nBrezhnev: But to have reached\n                            confidential agreement beforehand?\nKissinger: Confidentially.\nBrezhnev: So there will be a\n                            special signing ceremony in the Kremlin.\nKissinger: We will have a SALT agreement, there is no question.\nBrezhnev: I think so too.\nKissinger: I will let your\n                            Ambassador know by the end of the coming week when we can proceed in\n                            Helsinki, but it will be very soon.\nBrezhnev: Good, because there is\n                            not so much time left.\nKissinger: Let them talk about\n                            radars this week. They have a lot to talk about.\nBrezhnev: Yes. That\u2019s my view. I\n                            don\u2019t think they\u2019re in any hurry. They don\u2019t have much to talk about,\n                            but let them talk. Let them talk about the nature of the universe. The\n                            Delegations should be locked in a room for the final 3 days without food\n                            and told they must get an agreement or not get food for another 3\n                            days.\nKissinger: We\u2019ve reached the point\n                            where despite all the efforts of our delegations we will still reach an\n                            agreement.\nBrezhnev: No matter how hard they\n                            try! That\u2019s our success.\nKissinger: Our delegation is so\n                            complex we don\u2019t understand them anymore.\nBrezhnev: You want an example of\n                            how to make something very complex? I can pose one or two questions that\n                            neither you nor the President can solve for months. So we can consider\n                            this closed.\n\n\n\nSource: National Archives, Nixon Presidential\n                                Materials, NSC Files, Box 485,\n                                President\u2019s Trip Files, USSR\u2014Issues\n                                Papers, Vol. IV.
