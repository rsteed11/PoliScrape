About the Beta







About the Beta
The Office of the Historian is pleased to present a new version of our public website,
                        history.state.gov. In order to gather feedback and work out any remaining kinks, we are sharing the new site in “beta”—or preview form. Please have a
                        look around and send us your suggestions via email at
                        history@state.gov or on Twitter at
                        @HistoryAtState.
Features of the New Version

A mobile device-friendly “responsive” design: Adapts to the size of your device and
                            is readable on any screen size, from smart phone to desktop. (On a computer,
                            try making your browser window smaller, or, on a mobile device, try changing your screen’s
                            orientation; notice how the elements of the page adapt to the new size.) The new design
                            is aligned with U.S. Web Design
                                Standards.
                        
A fluid reading experience: Quickly advance forward or backward in publications
                            such as the Foreign Relations series. To try this out, visit this document and select the
                            “previous” or “next” arrows to the left and right of the document window.
                        
Improved security: Your connection to the beta site—and all of history.state.gov—is now encrypted.
                            This setting, called HSTS, forces all connections to the site to use a secure, HTTPS
                            connection, ensuring the integrity of the pages you visit and preventing others from
                            tracking which pages you visit or what terms you search for. For more on this standard
                            and its adoption by U.S. Government websites, see https.cio.gov.
                        
Improved stability and performance: We have rewritten
                            the entire site from scratch with the goal of delivering results faster
                            and sustaining heavier traffic. The new site is also running on multiple
                            servers in multiple data centers for improved performance under load.
Open data, open source code: All of the content and code on this site is
                            available for anyone to download. The core data repositories
                            are available at HistoryAtState on GitHub. The web application is available at the hsg-shell repository. Follow our
                            progress, fork our code, file issues, and send us your pull requests. The hsg-project
                            repository contains all instructions to install a complete copy of the
                            site on your own computer.

Known Issues
In the coming weeks we will be addressing the following notable known issues. Please report any other problems you have noticed.

Country Issues articles and the photo gallery from the Southeast Asia conference have not been migrated.
                            (#150)

Follow our progress on these and other issues at our GitHub issue tracker.
Features Planned for Future Releases
Besides these features, we are laying the foundation for new resources on the history
                        of U.S. foreign relations and the Department of State:

A unified biographical database of all persons identified in datasets such as the
                            Foreign Relations series, Principal Officers and Chiefs of Mission, Travels
                            of the President and Secretary of State, and Visits of Foreign Leaders.
A database of historical country names, for connecting resources about places whose
                            names have changed over time.
Chronological sorting of search results from the Foreign Relations series.

Thank you for your interest in our website, and please return for updates.

Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers,

Introductory note by the Editor
Historical Note

For documentation on arrangements for exploratory discussions on world
                        security organization (including the Dumbarton Oaks conversations August
                        21–October 7, 1944), see Foreign Relations, 1944, volume I, pages 614 ff.
The Conference of the United Nations was called to meet in San Francisco on
                        April 25, 1945, for the sole purpose of drafting the charter of a world
                        security organization, and concluded on June 26, 1945, after fifty-one days
                        of debate, negotiation, and drafting. The delegates of fifty governments
                        unanimously approved the Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the
                        International Court of Justice, and the “Interim Arrangements” for the
                        establishment of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in plenary
                        session on June 25. On the following day the Charter was signed by 153
                        delegates, and a space was left for the signature of Poland, whose
                        government was not represented at the Conference.
The United States Senate gave advice and consent to ratification of the
                        Charter of the United Nations and annexed Statute of the International Court
                        of Justice on July 28. President Truman ratified the
                        Charter with the Statute on August 8 and signed the United Nations
                        Participation Act of 1945 providing for United States participation in the
                        United Nations on December 20. The Charter came into force on October 24,
                        1945, when the five major powers and twenty-four other signatory states had
                        ratified the Charter. The original Protocol of Deposit of Ratifications of
                        the Charter of the United Nations, signed by Secretary of State
                            James F. Byrnes, was deposited, with the original
                        signed copy of the Charter and the Statute, in the Archives of the
                        Government of the United States.
Conference Structure and
                            Documentation

The Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, supplemented by later agreements, amendments,
                        comments, and proposals submitted by participating [Page 2]governments, constituted the agenda of the Conference. The
                        permanent organization of the Conference comprised four commissions, twelve
                        technical committees, and four general committees. The International
                        Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General of the Conference, provided
                        secretaries and clerical assistance for the committees, as well as
                        translating, documentation, communications, and other facilities for them
                        and the Conference as a whole.
The Charter was drafted in closed meetings of the twelve technical committees
                        and their subcommittees. Recommendations of each committee formulated on the
                        various parts of the agenda assigned to it were submitted on completion of
                        its work to the appropriate commission, and, in turn, each commission, after
                        consideration of the recommendations of its technical committees,
                        recommended to the Conference in plenary session proposed texts for adoption
                        as parts of the Charter. Nearly all of the important records of the
                        Conference were issued in mimeographed form and distributed daily. About
                        half a million sheets were reproduced each day. Documents of the commissions
                        and committees, in general, include agenda, summary reports of meetings, and
                        working documents. Verbatim minutes of the plenary sessions only were freely
                        distributed, although verbatim minutes of other meetings were available for
                        reference.
The principal documents of the United Nations Conference were published by
                        the United Nations Information Organizations (London and New York) in
                        cooperation with the Library of Congress in the 22-volume series entitled
                            Documents of the United Nations Conference on
                            International Organization. The series is available from the United
                        Nations, New York. This material, reproduced photolithographically, without
                        textual editing, from the mimeographed, printed, or photolithographed
                        originals, is presented in the two working languages of the Conference,
                        English and French. The final documents, however, the Charter, Statute of
                        the International Court of Justice, and the Interim Arrangements are
                        presented in the five official languages, Chinese, English, French, Russian,
                        and Spanish. An index covering the complete official documentation is
                        contained in volume 21. This volume provides a chronological legislative
                        history of each article of the Charter, an alphabetical subject key, tables
                        of correspondence between articles of the Charter of the United Nations and
                        the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, and a list of abbreviations used. An
                        explanation of the numbering and classification system for Conference
                        documentation is provided in volume 2 of the series, on pages 19, 27, and

Purpose and Scope of This
                        Compilation

This compilation constitutes a bridge between the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals
                        and the Charter of the United Nations. It concentrates on the role of the
                        United States in establishing the legal framework of the United Nations
                        Organization.
The underlying purpose is to present the American Delegation’s position in
                        relation to the various issues, discussions, and decisions at different
                        levels, such as informal diplomatic meetings, in Conference committees and
                        subcommittees, and informal meetings of individuals, with emphasis on the
                        why and how, and the atmosphere in which agreements were reached informally
                        among the major Powers on the various issues, rather than on what transpired
                        in the formal meetings of the Conference.
The preparation of United States policy recommendations for a general
                        international organization is traced chronologically from the first of the
                        year to completion on May 2, 1945, and issuance in the documentary form of
                        “Changes in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals as Suggested by the United States
                        Delegation”, and on May 4 in the form of “Amendments Proposed by the
                        Governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and
                        China.”
Substantive work of the Conference, which awaited availability of the joint
                        proposals of the Sponsors, began on May 7 with study of the Dumbarton Oaks
                        Proposals and the amendments presented by the Sponsors and other nations at
                        the Conference. From this point on to [Page 4]the signing of the Charter on June 26, the documentation presented herein
                        focuses on four phases of Conference activities: policy development,
                        negotiation, debates, and drafting. The evolution of United States policy on
                        the various subjects may be traced through the minutes of the seventy-nine
                        meetings of the United States Delegation. Informal negotiation outside
                        formal meetings, and coordination of proposed policies of the United States
                        with other major powers, may be traced through minutes of the twelve
                        meetings of the “Big Four” and twenty-nine meetings of the “Big Five”, as
                        well as minutes of a series of informal meetings with representatives of the
                        other American Republics. This documentation, unpublished heretofore, is
                        coordinated with the published documentation on Conference proceedings by
                        use of footnote citations at the appropriate points in order to trace action
                        taken by the American delegates in the various technical committees of the
                        Conference in accordance with the agreed position established within the
                        delegation as a whole for their guidance.
Many of the records of meetings included in this volume were informal notes
                        rather than official verbatim minutes approved by the participants.
Additional selected documentation printed herein includes extracts from the
                        daily record of Secretary of State Stettinius, memoranda of conversations of the Secretary with
                        other delegates, daily reports of the Secretary to the Department on
                        Conference developments, instructions to the Secretary from the Department,
                        Departmental correspondence, memoranda, diplomatic notes, policy statements,
                        and Presidential correspondence.
Occasional deletions of less important data have been made, necessarily,
                        within certain documents to save space but not without indications in the
                        text.
The documents were gathered from the central indexed files and the office and
                        post lot files of the Department of State, as well as from the Manuscript
                        Division of the Library of Congress, from the Department of the Interior,
                        from the United States Mission to the United Nations, from the
                            Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park, New
                        York, and from various Department of State publications.[Page 5]

Introductory note
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY: SELECTED PUBLIC DOCUMENTS
Beginning with the year 1950, American Foreign Policy, a
                    companion series to Foreign Relations of the United
                        States, provides systematic coverage of the principal messages,
                    addresses, statements, reports, and of certain of the diplomatic notes exchanged
                    and treaties made in a given period that indicate the scope, goals, and
                    implementation of the foreign policy of the United States. For the immediately
                    preceding years, 1945–1949 inclusive, the present series, Foreign Relations, will provide under this heading a brief indication

                    be complete, of course, and as a rule items dealing primarily with United States
                    relations with particular countries will be noted in the compilations for those
                    countries. Many of the items cited below are also referred to in appropriate

                    of State of its international information functions as well as the foreign
                    information functions of the Office of Inter-American Affairs. In a statement
                    released to the press on that date the President noted that “the nature of
                    present-day foreign relations makes it essential for the United States to
                    maintain informational activities abroad as an integral part of the conduct of
                    our foreign affairs” (Bulletin, September 2, 1945, pp.

                    to the Department of State the activities of the Research and Analysis Branch
                    and the Presentation Branch of the Office of Strategic Services. The order,
                    effective October 1, abolished the O.S.S. and transferred its remaining
                    activities to the War Department. The President added that the transfer [Page XI]would provide the Secretary of State
                    “with the resources which we have agreed you will need to aid in the development
                    of our foreign policy, and will assure that pertinent experience accumulated
                    during the war will be preserved and used in meeting the problems of the peace.”
                    The President further stated that he particularly desired the Secretary of State
                    “to take the lead in developing a comprehensive and coordinated foreign
                    intelligence program for all Federal agencies concerned with that type of
                    activity … through the creation of an interdepartmental group, heading up under
                    the State Department, which would formulate plans for my approval.” For texts of

Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers,
                    1945, General: The United Nations, Volume I

Preface






Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers,
                    1945, General: The United Nations, Volume I








Preface
This volume was prepared under the direct supervision of the former Chief of the
                    Foreign Relations Division, E. Ralph Perkins, assisted by
                    the present head of the division, S. Everett Gleason, and
                    by Fredrick Aandahl. The compilers of the volume were
                        Velma Hastings Cassidy, Ralph R.
                        Goodwin, and a former member of the Division, George H.
                        Dengler.
The Publishing and Reproduction Services Division (Jerome H.
                        Perlmutter, Chief) was responsible for the technical editing of
                    the volume. This function was performed in the Historical Editing Section under
                    the direct supervision of Elizabeth A. Vary, Chief, and
                        Ouida J. Ward, Assistant Chief.

Principles for the Compilation and Editing of
                            “Foreign Relations”

The principles which guide the compilation and editing of Foreign Relations are stated in Department of State Regulation
                        1350 of June 15, 1961, a revision of the order approved on March 26, 1925,
                        by Mr. Frank B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The
                        text of the current regulation is printed below:
1350 Documentary Record of American
                            Diplomacy

1351 Scope of Documentation

The publication Foreign Relations of the United States,
                            Diplomatic Papers, constitutes the official record of the foreign
                        policy of the United States. These volumes include, subject to necessary
                        security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record
                        of the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of
                        State’s responsibilities, together with appropriate materials concerning the
                        facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. When further
                        material is needed to supplement the documentation in the Department’s files
                        for a proper understanding of the relevant policies of the United States,
                        such papers should be obtained from other Government agencies.[Page IV]
1352 Editorial Preparation

The basic documentary diplomatic record to be printed in Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic Papers, shall
                        be edited by the Historical Office, Bureau of Public Affairs of the
                        Department of State. The editing of the record shall be guided by the
                        principles of historical objectivity. There shall be no alteration of the
                        text, no deletions without indicating where in the text the deletion is
                        made, and no omission of facts which were of major importance in reaching a
                        decision. Nothing shall be omitted for the purpose of concealing or glossing
                        over what might be regarded by some as a defect of policy. However, certain
                        omissions of documents are permissible for the following reasons: 
a.

To avoid publication of matters which would tend to impede current
                                diplomatic negotiations or other business.
b.

To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless
                                details.
c.

To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by
                                individuals and by foreign governments.
d.

To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or
                                individuals.
e.

To eliminate personal opinions presented in despatches and not
                                acted upon by the Department. To this consideration there is one
                                qualification—in connection with major decisions it is desirable,
                                where possible, to show the alternatives presented to the Department
                                before the decision was made.

1353 Clearance

To obtain appropriate clearances of material to be published in Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic
                            Papers, the Historical Office shall: 
a.

Refer to the appropriate policy offices of the Department and of
                                other agencies of the Government such papers as appear to require
                                policy clearance.
b.

Refer to the appropriate foreign governments requests for
                                permission to print as part of the diplomatic correspondence of the
                                United States those previously unpublished documents which were
                                originated by the foreign governments.

Overview
In keeping with the goal of the President’s Digital Government Strategy to deliver better digital services to the
                            American people, the Office of the Historian has created its first public Application Programming Interface
                            (API) and has established this page to house information for developers. We invite
                            developers to use our API and provide feedback.


Ebook Catalog API
The Office of the Historian Ebook Catalog API is a
                            RESTful, OPDS-formatted catalog of the growing number of free ebooks from the
                                Foreign Relations of the United States series. Use this API to embed
                            our live, up-to-date, searchable, and browsable ebook catalog in your application
                            and to locate download links to the ebooks and their cover images.


Support
Developers are welcome to visit our organizational account on GitHub. Requests or inquiries may
                            be submitted as issues.


Technologies &amp; Standards
This website is powered by eXist-db, a free, open
                            source XML server and the open standard W3C technologies it supports, including
                            XQuery 3.0, EXPath, and EXQuery.
Our digitization initiatives center around the Text
                                Encoding Initiative (TEI), an open, mature, XML-based standard used widely
                            in libraries and the humanities. All our article- and book-length content is encoded
                            as TEI. A single digital master TEI file can store an entire FRUS volume.
                            We store this TEI in eXist-db and convert it to TEI into HTML or ebook forms using
                            XQuery.
Our ebook catalog API uses the Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS), an Atom
                            XML-based standard for encoding ebook catalogs.

Open Government Initiative
Transparency, participation, and collaboration are the foundation of open government. In
                        keeping with this principle established in the President’s December 2009 Open
                            Government Directive, the Office of the Historian has adapted its publications to
                        open digital formats that can be accessed and consumed easily by the public, including third
                        party developers. In 2010, the Office of the Historian made the following submissions to
                        data.gov, which remain up to date: 
Bibliographic Metadata of the Foreign Relations of
                                        the United States Series: Raw bibliographic metadata for the nearly
                                500 volumes in the Foreign Relations of the
                                        United States series published since 1861. Each record in the
                                dataset contains a volume’s title, year of publication, years covered by the volume,
                                summary, and links to sources for these volumes online or in print, among other
                                metadata items. [Data.gov catalog entry]
Latest Volumes of Foreign Relations of the United
                                        States Series: This atom feed lists the ten most recently published
                                volumes in the Foreign Relations of the United
                                    States series. Each record in the dataset contains a volume’s title, year of
                                publication, summary, and link to the online volumes. The feed is updated as soon as
                                a new volume is published. [Data.gov catalog entry]

Building on this foundation and extending the focus beyond data, the President’s May 2012 Digital Government Strategy emphasized delivering better digital services to the
                        American people government through mobile devices and providing automated services for third
                        party web and app developers. In 2013, the Office of the Historian made the following
                        contributions to the Digital Government Strategy: 
Ebook Editions of Office of the Historian
                                Publications: The Foreign Relations of the United States
                                (FRUS) series, established in 1861, was adapted to ebook. Far lighter
                                and more portable than printed editions of FRUS, the ebook edition offers
                                the full content of each volume and makes use of the full-text search and other
                                reading features of most ebook devices and applications, including bookmarking and
                                note-taking. Unlike the web-based edition of FRUS, the ebook edition, once
                                downloaded, can be accessed even without internet connectivity. The ebooks were
                                generated from the master digital files at no additional cost and are available for
                                free download.
Office of the Historian Ebook Catalog API: This Application Programming Interface
                                (API) enables third party web and app developers, as well as users of these
                                applications, to embed the Office of the Historian ebook catalog. The API uses best
                                practices and open standards, including the
                                Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) format for ebook catalogs and REST interfaces.

Conferences
The Office of the Historian periodically hosts or co-hosts scholarly conferences on specific
                        topics of interest related to the history of U.S. foreign relations. These conferences
                        typically aim to bring together former diplomats and policymakers with respected scholars of
                        U.S. foreign relations. The Office of the Historian has also been successful in including
                        current policymakers in these conferences. These conferences are generally open to the
                        public, although pre-registration might be required.

About Us

Who We Are
The Office of the Historian is staffed by professional historians who are experts
                            in the history of U.S. foreign policy and the Department of State and possess
                            unparalleled research experience in classified and unclassified government
                            records. The Office’s historians work closely with other federal government
                            history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the
                            globe. The Office is directed by Dr. Stephen
                                Randolph, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.


What We Do
The Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and
                            publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the
                            Foreign Relations of the United States series.
In addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for
                            Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential
                            background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify
                            precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on
                            institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make
                            decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their
                            choices. The Office of the Historian conducts an array of initiatives, ranging
                            from briefing memos to multi-year research projects.
The Office of the Historian also promotes the declassification of documents to
                            ensure a complete and accurate understanding of the past.


Foreign Relations of the United States

The Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series presents the official
                            documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions. The series
                            began in 1861 and now comprises more than 480 individual volumes.
Foreign Relations volumes contain documents from the Presidential libraries,
                            Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central
                            Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign
                            affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in
                            implementing U.S. foreign policy.
Learn more about the series and view the collection at our Historical Documents page.


Our Outreach Activities
The Office’s public outreach activities include hosting scholarly conferences on
                            key issues in the history of U.S. foreign policy, answering historical research
                            questions, consulting with scholars, educators, and students, and working with
                            high school teachers across the country to provide high-quality materials for
                            classroom use.


How to Access Our Materials
The Office maintains a public website at history.state.gov,
                            which provides in-depth information to the public on the history of U.S. foreign
                            policy. In addition to a full text archive of
                                the Foreign Relations series, the website includes valuable
                            encyclopedic content on the history of U.S. relations
                                with states around the world, a database of the Department’s principal officers and
                                chiefs of mission, and special tools and
                                resources for students and teachers.
In keeping with the Open Government Directive’s principle of transparency,
                            participation, and collaboration as the cornerstone of an open government, the
                            Office of the Historian has begun preparing many of its rich historical
                            publications in a raw data format that can be accessed through data.gov. Please
                            visit our Open Government page to learn more about
                            these resources.

World Wide Diplomatic Archives Index
The Office of the Historian has for many years provided researchers a guide to
                        the accessibility of diplomatic archives around the world. This current list is based on
                        information received from American diplomatic posts abroad, as well as web
                        sources and communication with the archives themselves. The information provided
                        here is subject to change so researchers are advised to contact the government
                        or archive ahead of any planned visit. 
Select an article from the list of all countries.
While access to the diplomatic records of many countries remains highly
                        restricted, the news is better than ever before with many new countries
                        establishing Freedom of Information Acts to foment better government
                        transparency. 
The divide between the developed world and the developing world also affects the
                        state of international archives. Problems of infrastructure inhibit the nature
                        of information dissemination. The amount of information available on the
                        internet varies from country to country and many National Archives and
                        Ministries of Foreign Affairs are still in the process of developing workable
                        websites.
This site does not comment on the state of the records themselves. In addition to
                        the loss of records as a result of changes of government and civil war, the
                        climate has wreaked havoc upon some archives, particularly in tropical regions,
                        whose documents, despite the best efforts of archivists, have been compromised
                        by heat, humidity, flooding, and frequent power outages.
In compiling this database, the Office of the Historian has tried to give
                        researchers a starting place for their inquiries. We have not included anecdotal
                        advice on how to approach any given archive. Countries that do not
                        systematically declassify their documents may require personal contacts to gain
                        access to records of interest. Additionally, compliance with laws that guide
                        freedom of information may vary.
For the most part, diplomatic records are held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                        (or a similar department) or have been transferred to a National Archive. If
                        that is done systematically, it is usually apparent as to which records are
                        available for viewing. When transfer is not systematic, it is up to the
                        researcher to discover the location of the documents they wish to view as well
                        as to make contact with the relevant archivist.
The Office of the Historian would be happy to receive updated or missing
                        information. Please contact us.

This guide brings together information on these subjects from among
                        diverse and widely scattered documentary and archival sources. The most significant categories of
                        information provided for each individual country include: 

the date and circumstances under which the United States recognized, or was recognized by, each
                            state;
the date and mode by which the United States established diplomatic relations with each state;
the date the United States established a physical diplomatic presence through a legation, embassy,
                            or other mission in each country; 
and the dates and circumstances of any interruption or resumption of diplomatic relations. 

Over time, additional details will be added for each country, such
                        as information on the United States consular presence.
Finally, this section also provides historical information on some
                        territorial entities that the United States has not recognized or with which it does not have diplomatic
                        relations.

Now Available: Foreign Relations of the United States, 1981–1988, Volume VI,
        Soviet Union, October 1986–January 1989

This release, the second of four Soviet bilateral volumes, commences immediately
        following the dramatic encounter at Reykjavik, on October 10–11, 1986, where U.S. and Soviet
        leaders propelled the negotiation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and
        the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.








Now Available: Twenty Newly Digitized Foreign Relations Volumes

This release is part of the Office’s ongoing project, in partnership with the University
        of Wisconsin Digital Collections Center, to digitize the entire Foreign Relations series.
        These volumes cover events that took place between 1932 and 1939 and were originally
        published in print between 1947 and 1953.








Now Available: Foreign Relations of the United States, 1977–1980, Volume XVII, Part 1,
        Horn of Africa

The focus of the volume is on the Carter administration’s approach to events in the Horn of Africa
        and includes relations with Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti (before and after its
        independence).

This guide brings together information on these subjects from among
                        diverse and widely scattered documentary and archival sources. The most significant categories of
                        information provided for each individual country include: 

the date and circumstances under which the United States recognized, or was recognized by, each
                            state;
the date and mode by which the United States established diplomatic relations with each state;
the date the United States established a physical diplomatic presence through a legation, embassy,
                            or other mission in each country; 
and the dates and circumstances of any interruption or resumption of diplomatic relations. 

Over time, additional details will be added for each country, such
                        as information on the United States consular presence.
Finally, this section also provides historical information on some
                        territorial entities that the United States has not recognized or with which it does not have diplomatic
                        relations.

500.CC/3–2345
Memorandum of Conversation, by the Acting Secretary
                                of State


[Washington,]
                                March 23, 1945.

The Soviet Ambassador called at my home last evening at 8:30 at his
                            request and left with me the appended memorandum8 repeating the former request of the Soviet
                            Government that Poland be invited to attend the San Francisco
                            Conference.
I asked the Ambassador whether this memorandum was being likewise
                            delivered to the other sponsoring powers, Great Britain and China. Mr.
                                Gromyko said that he did not
                            know.
I said that we would give full consideration to this memorandum but in
                            the meantime I wished to say, in a purely informal way, that I thought
                            it would be difficult to invite Poland to attend the conference until
                            the proposed unified government had been set up. As things stand at
                            present, Soviet Russia recognizes the Lublin Government while we
                            recognize the Government in London, and it seems obvious that the
                            establishment of the unified government should precede the issuance of
                            invitations.

Memorandum by the Acting
                                        Secretary of State to President Roosevelt19


[Washington,]
                                    March 23, 1945.

Mr. Stettinius telephoned me
                                this afternoon and asked me to request your authorization for a
                                short statement along the following lines to be used in the event
                                that some announcement is made or that the news breaks in some other
                                way on the subject of the representation of the two Soviet Republics
                                in the International Organization.

At the Crimean Conference the Soviet Government stated that they
                                    intended to propose at the San Francisco Conference that the two
                                    Soviet Republic which had suffered most in the war, the Ukraine
                                    and White Russia, should be included among the list of original
                                    members of the Assembly when the Organization was established.
                                    It was agreed at the Conference that Great Britain and the
                                    United States would support this proposal. This is a matter for
                                    the nations convened at San Francisco to decide.20


I would, of course, avoid making any statement unless it becomes
                                absolutely necessary, although I might add that the story is in the
                                current issue of Newsweek and we are already
                                being questioned about it.

The Acting Secretary of
                                    State to the Ambassador in the United Kingdom
                                (Winant)12


Washington, March 23, 1945—noon.

2234. Gromyko recently called on
                            Mr. Dunn13 and informed him that the
                            Soviets were planning, in addition to their general delegation, to send
                            delegations to San Francisco representing White Russia and the Ukraine.
                            Mr. Dunn expressed surprise at
                            this telling the Ambassador that it did not follow the decisions reached
                            at Yalta as he understood them but as he had not been there he would
                            refer the whole matter to the Secretary.
The Secretary felt strongly that this was not in accordance with the
                            decisions reached at the Crimea and after talking this matter over with
                            the President,14 who also concurred, called
                                Gromyko in15 and told him very definitely that this went
                            beyond the Yalta decision and [Page 151]was entirely inconsistent with our understanding of it. The Secretary
                            told the Ambassador that he was basing his remarks on our records of
                            that Conference and that he was speaking for the President as well as
                            himself. The Secretary asked Gromyko to inform his Government of our feeling in this
                            matter which the Ambassador promised to do at once. The Secretary gained
                            the impression in his discussion with the Ambassador that he may not
                            have been requested by his Government to take this up officially with us
                            but that point is not certain.
For your own secret information what we did agree to at Yalta was that if
                            the Soviets should raise at San Francisco the question of these two
                            republics Becoming initial members of the organization that we would
                            support such a proposal. The British agreed to do likewise. The question
                            of the two republics being represented at San Francisco was actually
                            discussed at the Conference and a negative decision reached.16

The following is for your confidential information.
We have informed the British Embassy here of the action we have taken as
                            Mr. Eden had a similiar message
                            from Molotoff,17


Grew





The same message, with the exception of the
                                final two paragraphs, was transmitted by the Acting Secretary to the
                                Ambassador in the Soviet Union, for his information, in telegram
                                678, March 22, 11 p.m. The Secretary, in a telephone call of March
                                21 from “The Horseshoe”, had asked Mr. Lynch to have someone send a telegram to Moscow and
                                London with reference to his conversation with Mr. Gromyko the day
                            before.↩

See memorandum by Assistant Secretary of State
                                    Dunn, March 17, p. 132.↩

No record of conversation
                                found in Department files.↩

No record found of conversation with Mr. Gromyko, which Mr. Stettinius indicated took place on
                                March 20. For memorandum of points to be made by the Secretary in
                                talking to Ambassador Gromyko, see Conferences at Malta and Yalta, p.
                                    991.↩

500.CC/3–2345
Memorandum by the Acting
                                    Secretary of State to President Roosevelt


[Washington,]
                                March 23, 1945.

The Soviet Embassy has just informed us that the Soviet Delegation to San
                            Francisco will be as follows: 
A. A. Gromyko,
                                        Chairman18

U.S.S.R. Ambassador to the United States


K. V. Novicov

Chief of the British Department of the Soviet Foreign
                                            Office


S. K. Zarapkin

Chief of the American Section of the Foreign
                                            Office


A. A. Sobolev

Minister Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in
                                            London


S. A. Golunsky

Professor of International Law


Professor S. B. Krylov

Professor of International Law


Rear Admiral K. K.
                                        Rodionov

Lieutenant General A. F.
                                        Vasiliev


All of these with the exception of Novicov and
                                General Vasiliev were
                            present at the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, but it must be pointed out that
                            with the exception of the Ambassador this is not a high ranking
                            delegation. There is not even a Vice Commissar of Foreign Affairs or any
                            member of the Government of Cabinet rank.

Joseph C.
                                        Grew






This information was
                                            contrary to the expectation of the Department; V. M. Molotov, People’s
                                            Commissar for Foreign Affairs, was named as the likely
                                            head of the Soviet delegation in telegram 820, March 19,
                                            midnight, from Moscow (500.CC/3–1945).
In telegram 891, March 24, 2 p.m., Ambassador Harriman stated that
                                            the British Ambassador had been informed by Molotov that he would
                                            be unable to attend the Conference as there was to be a
                                            meeting of the Supreme Soviet at the same time to
                                            consider the budget (500.CC/3–2445).
For Prime Minister Churchill’s views
                                            on the withdrawal of Commissar Molotov from San
                                            Francisco and the relation of this action to the
                                            solution of the Polish problem and assurance of a
                                            successful conference, see telegram 925, March 27, from
                                            the British Prime Minister to President
                                                Roosevelt, vol. v, p. 185.↩

The Breakup of Yugoslavia, 1990–1992






Milestones: 1989–1992








The Breakup of Yugoslavia, 1990–1992
Issued on October 18, 1990, National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) 15–90 presented
                    a dire warning to the U.S. policy community:
Yugoslavia will cease to function as a federal state within a
                        year, and will probably dissolve within two. Economic reform will not stave
                        off the breakup. [...] A full-scale interrepublic war is unlikely, but
                        serious intercommunal conflict will accompany the breakup and will continue
                        afterward. The violence will be intractable and bitter. There is little the
                        United States and its European allies can do to preserve Yugoslav
                        unity.

The October 1990 judgment of the U.S. intelligence community, as Thomas Shreeve
                    noted in his 2003 study on NIE 15–90 for the National Defense University, “was
                    analytically sound, prescient, and well written. It was also fundamentally
                    inconsistent with what US policymakers wanted to happen in the former
                    Yugoslavia, and it had almost no impact on US policy.” By January 1992, the
                    Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ceased to exist, having dissolved into
                    its constituent states.
Yugoslavia—the land of South (i.e. Yugo) Slavs—was created at the end of World
                    War I when Croat, Slovenian, and Bosnian territories that had been part of the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire united with the Serbian Kingdom. The country broke up
                    under Nazi occupation during World War II with the creation of a Nazi-allied
                    independent Croat state, but was reunified at the end of the war when the
                    communist-dominated partisan force of Josip Broz Tito liberated the country.
                    Following the end of World War II, Yugoslavian unity was a top priority for the
                    U.S. Government. While ostensibly a communist state, Yugoslavia broke away from
                    the Soviet sphere of influence in 1948, became a founding member of the
                    Non-Aligned Movement in 1961, and adopted a more de-centralized and less
                    repressive form of government as compared with other East European communist
                    states during the Cold War.
The varied reasons for the country’s breakup ranged from the cultural and
                    religious divisions between the ethnic groups making up the nation, to the
                    memories of WWII atrocities committed by all sides, to centrifugal nationalist
                    forces. However, a series of major political events served as the catalyst for
                    exacerbating inherent tensions in the Yugoslav republic. Following the death of
                    Tito in 1980, provisions of the 1974 constitution provided for the effective
                    devolution of all real power away from the federal government to the republics
                    and autonomous provinces in Serbia by establishing a collective presidency of
                    the eight provincial representatives and a federal government with little
                    control over economic, cultural, and political policy. External factors also had
                    a significant impact. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, the
                    unification of Germany one year later, and the imminent collapse of the Soviet
                    Union all served to erode Yugoslavia’s political stability. As Eastern European
                    states moved away from communist government and toward free elections and market
                    economies, the West’s attention focused away from Yugoslavia and undermined the
                    extensive economic and financial support necessary to preserve a Yugoslav
                    economy already close to collapse. The absence of a Soviet threat to the
                    integrity and unity of Yugoslavia and its constituent parts meant that a
                    powerful incentive for unity and cooperation was removed.
Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia’s president from 1989, took advantage of the vacuum
                    created by a progressively weakening central state and brutally deployed the use
                    of Serbian ultra-nationalism to fan the flames of conflict in the other
                    republics and gain legitimacy at home. Milosevic started as a banker in Belgrade
                    and became involved in politics in the mid-1980s. He rose quickly through the
                    ranks to become head of the Serbian Communist Party in 1986. While attending a
                    party meeting in the Albanian-dominated province of Kosovo in May 1987, Serbians
                    in the province rioted outside the meeting hall. Milosevic spoke with the
                    rioters and listened to their complaints of mistreatment by the Albanian
                    majority. His actions were extensively reported by Serbian-controlled Yugoslav
                    mass media, beginning the process of transforming the former banker into the
                    stalwart symbol of Serbian nationalism. Having found a new source of legitimacy,
                    Milosevic quickly shored up his power in Serbia through control of the party
                    apparatus and the press. He moved to strip the two autonomous provinces of
                    Kosovo and Vojvodina of their constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy within Serbia
                    by using mass rallies to force the local leaderships to resign in favor of his
                    own preferred candidates. By mid-1989 Kosovo and Vojvodina had been reintegrated
                    into Serbia, and the Montenegro leadership was replaced by Milosevic allies.
The ongoing effects of democratization in Eastern Europe were felt throughout
                    Yugoslavia. As Milosevic worked to consolidate power in Serbia, elections in
                    Slovenia and Croatia in 1990 gave non-communist parties control of the state
                    legislatures and governments. Slovenia was the first to declare “sovereignty” in
                    1990, issuing a parliamentary declaration that Slovenian law took precedence
                    over Yugoslav law. Croatia followed in May, and in August, the Yugoslav republic
                    of Bosnia-Herzegovina also declared itself sovereign. Slovenia and Croatia began
                    a concerted effort to transform Yugoslavia from a federal state to a
                    confederation. With the administration of George H. W. Bush focused primarily on
                    the Soviet Union, Germany, and the crisis in the Persian Gulf, Yugoslavia had
                    lost the geostrategic importance it enjoyed during the Cold War. While
                    Washington attempted during the summer of 1990 to marshal some limited
                    coordination with its Western allies in case the Yugoslav crisis turned bloody,
                    Western European governments maintained a wait-and-see attitude. At the same
                    time, inter-republic relations in Yugoslavia spiraled out of control. Slovenia
                    overwhelmingly voted for independence in December 1990. A Croatian referendum in
                    May 1991 also supported full independence. Secretary of State James Baker
                    traveled to Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav leaders and urge a political solution
                    to no avail. Slovenia and Croatia both declared formal independence on June 25,
                    1991.
The Yugoslav Army (JNA) briefly intervened in Slovenia, but it withdrew after 10
                    days, effectively confirming Slovenia’s separation. The Serb minority in Croatia
                    declared its own independence from the republic and its desire to join Serbia,
                    sparking violence between armed militias. The JNA intervened in the conflict
                    ostensibly to separate the combatants, but it became quickly apparent that it
                    favored the Croatian-Serbs. The war that followed devastated Croatia, resulting
                    in tens of thousands dead, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In
                    Bosnia-Herzegovina, a referendum on independence took place in March 1992, but
                    was boycotted by the Serb minority. The republic declared its independence from
                    Yugoslavia in May 1992, while the Serbs in Bosnia declared their own areas an
                    independent republic. Macedonia itself also declared independence following a
                    September 1991 referendum, and a U.S. peacekeeping and monitoring force was
                    dispatched to the border with Serbia to monitor violence.
Croatia and Slovenia were internationally recognized in January 1992, with
                    Bosnia’s independence recognized soon thereafter. The three countries joined the
                    United Nations on May 22, 1992. Serbia and Montenegro formed a new Federal
                    Republic of Yugoslavia as a successor state to old Yugoslavia, but the
                    international community did not recognize its successor claim. Over the next
                    three years, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina claimed hundreds of thousands of
                    lives and displaced millions from their homes, as Europe witnessed the most
                    horrific fighting on its territory since the end of World War II. In 1998–1999,
                    violence erupted again in Kosovo, with the province’s majority Albanian
                    population calling for independence from Serbia. A NATO bombing campaign and
                    economic sanctions forced the Milosevic regime to accept a NATO-led
                    international peace keeping force. The province was placed under U.N.
                    administrative mandate. With the economy crumbling, Milosevic lost his grip on
                    power in 2001, was arrested, and turned over to the International Crimes
                    Tribunal in The Hague. He died in prison in 2006, before his trial concluded. In
                    2008, Kosovo declared independence and was recognized by the United States and
                    most European states, despite Russian objections.

The Collapse of the Soviet Union






Milestones: 1989–1992








The Collapse of the Soviet Union
After his inauguration in January 1989, George H.W. Bush did
                    not automatically follow the policy of his predecessor, Ronald
                        Reagan, in dealing with Mikhail Gorbachev
                    and the Soviet Union. Instead, he ordered a strategic policy re-evaluation in
                    order to establish his own plan and methods for dealing with the Soviet Union
                    and arms control.

Boris Yeltsin makes a speech from atop a tank in front of the Russian
                        parliament building in Moscow, U.S.S.R., Monday, Aug. 19, 1991. (AP Photo)
                    

Conditions in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, however, changed rapidly.
                    Gorbachev’s decision to loosen the Soviet yoke on the countries of Eastern
                    Europe created an independent, democratic momentum that led to the collapse of
                    the Berlin Wall in November 1989, and then the overthrow of Communist rule
                    throughout Eastern Europe. While Bush supported these independence movements,
                    U.S. policy was reactive. Bush chose to let events unfold organically, careful
                    not to do anything to worsen Gorbachev’s position.
With the policy review complete, and taking into account unfolding events in
                    Europe, Bush met with Gorbachev at Malta in early December 1989. They laid the
                    groundwork for finalizing START negotiations, completing the Conventional Forces
                    in Europe treaty, and they discussed the rapid changes in Eastern Europe. Bush
                    encouraged Gorbachev’s reform efforts, hoping that the Soviet leader would
                    succeed in shifting the USSR toward a democratic system and a market oriented
                    economy.
Gorbachev’s decision to allow elections with a multi-party system and create a
                    presidency for the Soviet Union began a slow process of democratization that
                    eventually destabilized Communist control and contributed to the collapse of the
                    Soviet Union. Following the May 1990 elections, Gorbachev faced conflicting
                    internal political pressures: Boris Yeltsin and the pluralist movement advocated
                    democratization and rapid economic reforms while the hard-line Communist elite
                    wanted to thwart Gorbachev’s reform agenda.
Facing a growing schism between Yeltsin and Gorbachev, the Bush administration
                    opted to work primarily with Gorbachev because they viewed him as the more
                    reliable partner and because he made numerous concessions that promoted U.S.
                    interests. Plans proceeded to sign the START agreement. With the withdrawal of
                    Red Army troops from East Germany, Gorbachev agreed to German reunification and
                    acquiesced when a newly reunited Germany joined NATO. When Saddam Hussein
                    invaded Kuwait, the United States and the Soviet leadership worked together
                    diplomatically to repel this attack.
Yet for all of those positive steps on the international stage, Gorbachev’s
                    domestic problems continued to mount. Additional challenges to Moscow’s control
                    placed pressure on Gorbachev and the Communist party to retain power in order to
                    keep the Soviet Union intact. After the demise of Communist regimes in Eastern
                    Europe, the Baltic States and the Caucasus demanded independence from Moscow. In
                    January 1991, violence erupted in Lithuania and Latvia. Soviet tanks intervened
                    to halt the democratic uprisings, a move that Bush resolutely condemned.
By 1991, the Bush administration reconsidered policy options in light of the
                    growing level of turmoil within the Soviet Union. Three basic options presented
                    themselves. The administration could continue to support Gorbachev in hopes of
                    preventing Soviet disintegration. Alternately, the United States could shift
                    support to Yeltsin and the leaders of the Republics and provide support for a
                    controlled restructuring or possible breakup of the Soviet Union. The final
                    option consisted of lending conditional support to Gorbachev, leveraging aid and
                    assistance in return for more rapid and radical political and economic reforms. 
Unsure about how much political capital Gorbachev retained, Bush combined
                    elements of the second and third options. The Soviet nuclear arsenal was vast,
                    as were Soviet conventional forces, and further weakening of Gorbachev could
                    derail further arms control negotiations. To balance U.S. interests in relation
                    to events in the Soviet Union, and in order to demonstrate support for
                    Gorbachev, Bush signed the START treaty at the Moscow Summit in July 1991. Bush
                    administration officials also, however, increased contact with Yeltsin.
The unsuccessful August 1991 coup against Gorbachev sealed the fate of the Soviet
                    Union. Planned by hard-line Communists, the coup diminished Gorbachev’s power
                    and propelled Yeltsin and the democratic forces to the forefront of Soviet and
                    Russian politics. Bush publicly condemned the coup as “extra-constitutional,”
                    but Gorbachev’s weakened position became obvious to all. He resigned his
                    leadership as head of the Communist party shortly thereafter—separating the
                    power of the party from that of the presidency of the Soviet Union. The Central
                    Committee was dissolved and Yeltsin banned party activities. A few days after
                    the coup, Ukraine and Belarus declared their independence from the Soviet Union.
                    The Baltic States, which had earlier declared their independence, sought
                    international recognition.
Amidst quick, dramatic changes across the landscape of the Soviet Union, Bush
                    administration officials prioritized the prevention of nuclear catastrophe, the
                    curbing of ethnic violence, and the stable transition to new political orders.
                    On September 4, 1991, Secretary of State James Baker articulated five basic
                    principles that would guide U.S. policy toward the emerging republics:
                    self-determination consistent with democratic principles, recognition of
                    existing borders, support for democracy and rule of law, preservation of human
                    rights and rights of national minorities, and respect for international law and
                    obligations. The basic message was clear—if the new republics could follow these
                    principles, they could expect cooperation and assistance from the United States.
                    Baker met with Gorbachev and Yeltsin in an attempt to shore up the economic
                    situation and develop some formula for economic cooperation between the
                    republics and Russia, as well as to determine ways to allow political reforms to
                    occur in a regulated and peaceful manner. In early December, Yeltsin and the
                    leaders of Ukraine and Belarus met in Brest to form the Commonwealth of
                    Independent States (CIS), effectively declaring the demise of the Soviet
                    Union.
On December 25, 1991, the Soviet hammer and sickle flag lowered for the last time
                    over the Kremlin, thereafter replaced by the Russian tricolor. Earlier in the
                    day, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned his post as president of the Soviet Union,
                    leaving Boris Yeltsin as president of the newly independent Russian state.
                    People all over the world watched in amazement at this relatively peaceful
                    transition from former Communist monolith into multiple separate nations.
With the dissolution of Soviet Union, the main goal of the Bush administration
                    was economic and political stability and security for Russia, the Baltics, and
                    the states of the former Soviet Union. Bush recognized all 12 independent
                    republics and established diplomatic relations with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus,
                    Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. In February 1992, Baker visited the
                    remaining republics and diplomatic relations were established with Uzbekistan,
                    Moldova, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Civil war in Georgia
                    prevented its recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the
                    United States until May 1992. Yeltsin met with Bush at Camp David in February
                    1992, followed by a formal state visit to Washington in June. Leaders from
                    Kazakhstan and Ukraine visited Washington in May 1992.
During his visits to Washington, politics, economic reforms, and security issues
                    dominated the conversations between Yeltsin and Bush. Of paramount concern was
                    securing the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union and making certain
                    nuclear weapons did not fall into the wrong hands. Baker made it clear that
                    funding was available from the United States to secure nuclear, chemical and
                    biological weapons in the former Soviet Union. The Nunn-Lugar Act established
                    the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program in November 1991 to fund the
                    dismantling of weapons in the former Soviet Union, in accordance with the START
                    and INF Treaties and other agreements. Bush and Baker also worked with Yeltsin
                    and international organizations like the World Bank and IMF to provide financial
                    assistance and hopefully prevent a humanitarian crisis in Russia.

Department History







Department History
Since its creation in 1789, the Department of State has carried out a series
                    of reorganizations and has created new offices and bureaus to deal with
                    new diplomatic challenges.
This portion of our website contains
                    a short history of the
                        department, biographies
                            of the Secretaries of State, a database of
                    Principal Officers and Chiefs of Mission, and a history of
                    the buildings of the Department of State.
The Department of State has grown significantly over the years.  The first Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. 
World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945) brought vastly increased global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent power.  New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, included:
                    
the newly independent states,
the global economy,
terrorism, and
the security of the American overseas presence. 

To address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to:
                    
1,228 in 1900,
1,968 in 1940,
13,294 in 1960,
and 15,751 in the year 2000.

The number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and continues to grow.

About Us

Who We Are
The Office of the Historian is staffed by professional historians who are experts
                            in the history of U.S. foreign policy and the Department of State and possess
                            unparalleled research experience in classified and unclassified government
                            records. The Office’s historians work closely with other federal government
                            history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the
                            globe. The Office is directed by Dr. Stephen
                                Randolph, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.


What We Do
The Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and
                            publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the
                            Foreign Relations of the United States series.
In addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for
                            Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential
                            background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify
                            precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on
                            institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make
                            decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their
                            choices. The Office of the Historian conducts an array of initiatives, ranging
                            from briefing memos to multi-year research projects.
The Office of the Historian also promotes the declassification of documents to
                            ensure a complete and accurate understanding of the past.


Foreign Relations of the United States

The Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series presents the official
                            documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions. The series
                            began in 1861 and now comprises more than 480 individual volumes.
Foreign Relations volumes contain documents from the Presidential libraries,
                            Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central
                            Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign
                            affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in
                            implementing U.S. foreign policy.
Learn more about the series and view the collection at our Historical Documents page.


Our Outreach Activities
The Office’s public outreach activities include hosting scholarly conferences on
                            key issues in the history of U.S. foreign policy, answering historical research
                            questions, consulting with scholars, educators, and students, and working with
                            high school teachers across the country to provide high-quality materials for
                            classroom use.


How to Access Our Materials
The Office maintains a public website at history.state.gov,
                            which provides in-depth information to the public on the history of U.S. foreign
                            policy. In addition to a full text archive of
                                the Foreign Relations series, the website includes valuable
                            encyclopedic content on the history of U.S. relations
                                with states around the world, a database of the Department’s principal officers and
                                chiefs of mission, and special tools and
                                resources for students and teachers.
In keeping with the Open Government Directive’s principle of transparency,
                            participation, and collaboration as the cornerstone of an open government, the
                            Office of the Historian has begun preparing many of its rich historical
                            publications in a raw data format that can be accessed through data.gov. Please
                            visit our Open Government page to learn more about
                            these resources.

                            (Exec)
Minutes of the Second Meeting (Executive, Session) of the
                                United States Delegation, Held at Washington, Friday, March 23,
                                1943, 10 a.m.

[Informal Notes—Extracts]

[Here follows list of names of persons (14) present at meeting.]
[At the request of the Acting Secretary this meeting was declared off the
                                record.]9

Relation of Private Organizations to
                                the Conference

The Acting Secretary opened the meeting by
                            stating that Mr. Stettinius had
                            asked him to call this special meeting to discuss an important question
                            that had arisen in connection with the San Francisco Conference. …
The Acting Secretary said that the point to be
                            taken up at the Secretary’s request concerned the relation of private
                            organizations [Page 149]and groups in
                            this country to the San Francisco Conference. In this connection two
                            documents were distributed: Draft of Letter to be Sent to Various
                            Private National Organizations and a list entitled Private National
                                Organizations.10

The Acting Secretary pointed out that a great
                            number of private organizations and groups want to be represented in San
                            Francisco and that there were good reasons why many of them should be
                            there. However, it was felt to be unfortunate to overload the official
                            Delegation with such representatives, although the possibility had been
                            considered of recognizing official representatives of a number of these
                            organizations as official advisers to the Delegation. If this plan were
                            adopted, however, the Delegation Would reach tremendous proportions.
The Acting Secretary stated that the thought in
                            the Department now was that each organization named on the list of
                            private national organizations would send one representative to San
                            Francisco to be there for consultation as this might prove desirable.
                            These representatives would not be official members of the American
                            Delegation, but a full system of liaison would be set up to keep them
                            closely in touch with the progress of the work. The representatives
                            would be consulted from time to time as appropriate.
. . . . . . .
Senator Vandenberg urged that, if proper emphasis was
                            put upon the fact that the United Nations Conference at San Francisco
                            was to be a “peace-keeping” show and not a “peace-making” show, then a
                            large number of organizations seeking representation would not be
                            interested. Representative Eaton agreed that a clear
                            statement of what the Conference was to do would alleviate the
                            situation.
The Acting Secretary asked Mr. Hiss to note that a statement along the
                            lines suggested by Senator Vandenberg and Representative Eaton should be prepared.
. . . . . . .
At this point the meeting was adjourned to enable the Delegates to go to
                            the White House.11

. . . . . . .
The Acting Secretary asked Mr. MacLeish if he would be responsible for
                            drafting the statement under discussion. Mr.
                                    MacLeish asked
                            whether the decision taken by the Delegates implied that the number of
                            official advisers would be increased. There was general agreement that
                            this was not implied. Mr. MacLeish stated that he had one
                            thing further in mind which he thought should be emphasized: [Page 150]the people of this country, indeed the
                            people of the world had been invited to discuss the Dumbarton Oaks
                            Proposals and think about them. The statement that was now to be drawn
                            up, he felt, should not discourage them in any way from continuing to
                            discuss and to think about the Proposals, nor should it play down the
                            San Francisco Conference. In a real sense, he said, that Conference was
                            the people’s show. We would have to give the impression that they could
                            come to it yet not invite them—a difficult thing to do.
Senator Connally added that the statement should stress
                            the impracticality of delegates conferring with large numbers of
                            representatives due to their heavy duties and schedules. Representative Bloom agreed that the statement should not play
                            up the role of the people at the Conference at the expense of the
                            Delegates so that the Delegates would be unable to perform their primary
                            responsibilities at San Francisco.
. . . . . . .
The meeting was adjourned by the Acting Secretary at 12:30 p.m.

Milestones in the History of U.S. Foreign Relations
“Milestones in the History of U.S. Foreign Relations” provides a general overview of the
                    history of U.S. engagement with the world through short essays on important moments,
                    or milestones, in the diplomatic history of the United States. The basic objective of these essays is to
                    provide a clear, accurate, narrative account of the events being discussed, with a brief
                    discussion of each event’s significance for U.S. foreign policy and diplomatic history. The
                    publication is divided into 19 chapters covering time periods from 1750 until 2000,
                    with brief introductions providing context for each period.

1989–1992
                                
1993–2000
                                


The essays were drafted for the Office of the Historian website by many historians over many
                    years, and we continue to revise and expand the existing periods. Most recently, the essays
                    covering the Kennedy and Johnson (1961–68), Nixon and Ford (1969–76), Carter (1977–80), Reagan (1981–88), Bush (1989–92), and Clinton (1993–2000) administrations were revised and
                    expanded. These same essays were also enhanced with “tags,” or lists of the key people,
                    places, and topics in the essay. The tags appear as links in the right sidebar of the essay
                    and facilitate discovery of other other essays and resources, including volumes from the
                        Foreign Relations of the United States series, on these subjects. The “tags”
                    feature is still in progress, and over time the Office will extend the tags to all of the
                    essays.
To begin, select a period from the sidebar, or view a list of all milestones.

1989-1992

The Madrid Conference, 1991






Milestones: 1989–1992








The Madrid Conference, 1991
On March 6, 1991, President George H. W. Bush told Congress,
                    “The time has come to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict.” Bush’s
                    declaration was followed by eight months of intensive shuttle diplomacy by
                    Secretary of State James Baker, culminating in the Madrid
                    Peace Conference in October 1991. The Conference, co-chaired by Bush and Soviet
                    President Mikhail Gorbachev, was attended by Israeli,
                    Egyptian, Syrian, and Lebanese delegations, as well as a joint
                    Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. For the first time, all of the parties to the
                    Arab-Israeli conflict had gathered to hold direct negotiations—a historically
                    unprecedented event.

The Conference’s long-term impact, however, was more limited than the Bush
                    administration had hoped. Following Madrid, Israeli, Syrian, Jordanian, and
                    Palestinian representatives continued to meet for bilateral talks in Washington,
                    and multilateral talks commenced in Moscow in 1992. Yet by 1993, the Washington
                    talks had become deadlocked and were overtaken by secret Israeli-Palestinian and
                    Israeli-Jordanian negotiations, which produced the Israeli-Palestinian
                    Declaration of Principles (the so-called “Oslo Accord”) of September 1993 and
                    the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty of October 1994.
From the Intifada to Madrid 

The United States began trying to convene an international Middle East peace
                    conference during the final year of Ronald Reagan’s
                    Presidency. In December 1987, the Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza
                    Strip had risen up against Israeli military rule. Hoping to stop the violence
                    and address Palestinian grievances, Secretary of State George
                        Shultz called for an international convention that would serve as
                    a prelude to direct negotiations between Israel, Jordan, and local Palestinians
                    on interim autonomy for the occupied territories, followed by talks on a
                    permanent status agreement. Shultz’s plan, however, went nowhere. Israel
                    rejected the Secretary’s proposals because they did not call for an end to the
                    Palestinian uprising, or intifada,as a precondition to
                    negotiations. In July 1988, Jordan’s King Hussein rendered the Shultz Plan
                    unworkable when he renounced his kingdom’s links to the West Bank.
Throughout 1989–1990, U.S. peacemaking efforts centered on a plan put forward by
                    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which called for the
                    Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect representatives who would
                    negotiate interim arrangements for self-governance with Israel, followed by a
                    permanent status agreement. U.S. and Egyptian efforts to build on this proposal
                    ultimately faltered over Israel’s insistence on vetting potential Palestinian
                    candidates for ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In March
                    1990, controversy over how to proceed with Shamir’s plan led to the fall of
                    Israel’s national unity government, putting diplomacy on hold. The failure of
                    the plan, combined with sharp U.S.-Israeli exchanges over Israeli
                    settlement-building in the occupied territories, strained relations between Bush
                    and Shamir. However, American efforts to bring the PLO into the peace process
                    fared no better. In November 1988, the PLO finally met U.S. demand that it
                    renounce terrorism and accept U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338,
                    which called for Arab-Israeli peace and mutual recognition accompanied by
                    Israeli withdrawal from “territories” it had occupied in 1967. Nevertheless,
                    diplomatic contacts between the two sides remained at a low level and were cut
                    off in June 1990, when Chairman Yasir Arafat refused to condemn a terrorist
                    attack perpetrated by the Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction.
By March 1991, the Persian Gulf War had created a more favorable context for
                    American peacemaking efforts. The Bush administration’s successful military
                    campaign against Iraq left the President enormously popular at home, and
                    highlighted America’s increasingly dominant role in a post-Cold War Middle East.
                    The Soviet Union had not strongly opposed American intervention, and Arab
                    states, including former Soviet client Syria, joined the coalition against
                    Saddam Hussein. At the same time, the administration felt a need to reward its
                    Arab partners for their support by pushing for progress on the Palestinian
                    issue. Since the PLO backed Iraq during the war, it had alienated Egypt, Syria,
                    and most of the Gulf States, and lost influence over Palestinians in the
                    occupied territories. The Bush administration thus had an opportunity to bring
                    Palestinians into the diplomatic process under conditions that the Israelis
                    might accept.
Between March and October 1991, Baker succeeded in getting Arab leaders and
                    Palestinian representatives from the occupied territories to drop their demands
                    that PLO officials and Palestinians from East Jerusalem participate in an
                    international peace conference. Instead, the Arab parties agreed that the
                    Palestinians would only be represented by delegates from the occupied
                    territories, and as part of a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation.
                    Simultaneously, Baker and Bush put pressure on Shamir to drop Israel’s
                    insistence on bilateral negotiations by withholding $10 billion in loan
                    guarantees that he had requested to help settle Jewish immigrants from the
                    Soviet Union. The President insisted that Shamir would have to promise that the
                    funds would not be used to finance new settlement activity in the occupied
                    territories. Shamir refused to accept Bush’s demand, but it undoubtedly played a
                    role in his decision to come to Madrid.
The Conference and its Aftermath

The Madrid Conference opened October 30, 1991, and ended on November 4. Though
                    the parties largely stuck to their traditional positions and did not negotiate
                    seriously with each other, they nevertheless agreed to remain in dialogue.
                    Bilateral talks between Israeli officials and their Arab counterparts would
                    begin in Washington in December 1991, while multilateral negotiations began in
                    Moscow in January 1992. From the beginning, the bilateral talks were generally
                    regarded as the more significant of the two tracks. While these talks acquired
                    greater momentum following the election of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
                    in June 1992, they failed to yield results before the Clinton administration
                    took office. Ultimately, the Israeli-Jordanian and Israeli-Palestinian tracks
                    established at Madrid would be circumvented by the parties themselves.
                    Frustrated by the Palestinian delegation’s inability to move forward without
                    Arafat’s approval, the Israelis decided to negotiate directly with the PLO,
                    culminating in the signing of the Declaration of Principles on September 13,
                    1993. King Hussein and the Israelis likewise decided to move forward
                    independently of the Madrid framework, holding direct talks which produced a
                    peace treaty by October 1994.

The Acting Secretary of
                                    State to the Ambassador in the United Kingdom
                                (Winant)21


Washington, March 23,
                            1945—midnight.

2267. The Department has received from the League of Nations, the
                            Permanent Court of International Justice, the International Labor
                            Organization, the Interim Commission on Food and Agriculture, and the
                            United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration requests that
                            they be invited to send representatives to the United Nations Conference
                            at San Francisco. All these are inter-governmental organizations. There
                            have also been formal and informal inquiries from non-governmental
                            international organizations.
We believe that a clear distinction should be drawn between
                            intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental international
                            organizations. The latter should not be invited or encouraged to send
                            representatives, but no obstacles would be placed in the way of their
                            voluntarily sending representatives to San Francisco.
As regards inter-governmental organizations, the Department would
                            appreciate being advised whether the other sponsoring governments would
                            have any objection to this Government making arrangements for unofficial
                            representation at San Francisco of the above named organizations. Such
                            representation would be limited to not more than two or three persons
                            for each organization. These are organizations which will eventually be
                            liquidated or modified as a result of the creation of the proposed
                            United Nations organization or which may be brought into formal or
                            informal relationship with the new organization.
Please take this matter up with the Foreign Minister and inform the
                            Department as promptly as possible of his views concerning this
                            matter:
Repeated to Moscow and Chungking.22

                                691 and 486, respectively. The Department was informed of the
                                Chinese and the British concurrence in the proposal in telegram 525,
                                March 28 from Chungking (500.CC/3–2845), and 3648, April 10, from
                                London (500.CC/4–1045). In telegram 999, April 1, 1 p.m., from
                                Moscow, Ambassador Harriman
                                reported: “Molotov has
                                written me under date of March 31 to effect that Soviet Government
                                agrees to participation of non-official representatives of the
                                inter-Governmental organizations set forth in Department’s 691,
                                March 23, midnight at San Francisco Conference. … He concludes that
                                Soviet Government also agrees with opinion of American Government
                                that non-Governmental international organizations should not be
                                invited to San Francisco Conference.” (500.CC/4–145)↩

1750-1775

Proclamation Line of 1763, Quebec Act of 1774 and Westward Expansion






Milestones: 1750–1775








Proclamation Line of 1763, Quebec Act of 1774 and Westward Expansion
The British won vast territory in North America after the Seven Years’ War, but
                    with the land came numerous problems of how to govern it. Conflicts arose from
                    the inability of British officials to balance the interests of colonists and
                    Indians, which led to colonial dissatisfaction with imperial rule and,
                    ultimately, to the causes of the American Revolution.

The Proclamation Line of 1763—between the red colored colonies and the
                        pink territories

The Treaty of Paris of 1763 that ended the Seven Years’ War provided Great
                    Britain with enormous territorial gains. Under the treaty, Canada and the entire
                    present-day United States east of the Mississippi came under British control.
                    With the official end of the war, Anglo-American colonists began to pour over
                    the Appalachian Mountains in search of land. As the native population had made
                    no land cessions, many of these settlers had no official claim to the land. In
                    many cases, the land was claimed by private land companies, in which the
                    Virginia elite had invested heavily in an attempt to diversify their holdings
                    outside of the volatile tobacco market. Thus, they had an interest in pressing
                    the British Government to address ensuing tensions.
The settlement of the lands west of the Appalachians brought inevitable tension
                    and conflict between settlers and indigenous peoples. British military officials
                    attempted to halt settlement, but eager settlers and land speculators ignored
                    their directives. With the military unwilling to forcibly remove settlers from
                    the lands, Anglo-American colonists continued to migrate west and lay claim
                    these lands.
British officials made the situation worse by alienating American Indians who had
                    been allied with France during the Seven Years’ War. The French Government had
                    devoted significant resources to furnishing gifts to their Indian allies. When
                    British forces arrived to take over former French forts, they halted the
                    gift-giving practice, not realizing that doing so undercut the authority of any
                    pro-British leaders within indigenous communities and antagonized the Indian
                    leaders.
In response to British actions and western settlement, the leader of the Ottawa
                    tribe, Pontiac, sent messages encoded in wampum belts to other communities
                    throughout the present-day Midwest to coordinate an attack on British forts.
                    Unaware of the depth of Indian anger and resentment, British forces were caught
                    largely by surprise and lost all their western forts except for Fort Pitt and
                    Detroit, where British military officials were tipped off and, therefore, able
                    to prevent seizure.
When news of the rebellion reached London, the government decided to put into
                    action a plan for creating a western Indian reserve, and produced the Royal
                    Proclamation of 1763, which forbid colonial settlement beyond the line of the
                    Appalachian Mountains. The act also created the provinces of Quebec, West
                    Florida, and East Florida. The proclamation was largely ineffective in
                    preventing western settlement, and served only to anger both settlers and the
                    political elite who had invested in western land speculation.
War with the Indian tribes continued from 1764 into 1766. British officials
                    managed to negotiate peace with the Senecas in the Niagara region and with
                    Indians in the upper Ohio River valley, and, in 1766, Pontiac agreed to a formal
                    treaty signed at Fort Ontario on July 25. Pontiac’s War is diplomatically
                    significant because it was the first war between European settlers and American
                    Indians where Indians had united broadly across tribal lines.
After the end of Pontiac’s rebellion, regulation of the western frontier was not
                    significantly altered until Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774. With this
                    piece of legislation, the British intended to preempt any dissatisfaction among
                    the French Canadian population by restoring French civil law and allowing
                    Catholics to hold office. It also imposed direct crown rule on Quebec and
                    extended Quebec’s borders south to the Ohio River.
The Quebec Act angered the Virginia elite, since most of the western lands they
                    claimed were now officially part of Quebec or in the Indian reserve. The act,
                    which Parliament passed at the same time as legislation placing Massachusetts
                    under crown control, also fueled resentment among Calvinist New Englanders, who
                    saw in its autocratic, pro-Catholic provisions further evidence of an imperial
                    conspiracy against colonial liberties.
When the American Revolution began in 1774, tensions between settlers and Indians
                    became a part of the conflict. The Continental Congress’s attempts to secure
                    Indian alliances largely failed, as most Indians saw the British military as the
                    lesser of two evils in their struggle against settlers’ encroachments upon their
                    land. However, the Oneida and Tuscarora Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy did
                    side with the colonists.
The ultimate effect of British frontier policy was to unite frontiersmen,
                    Virginia land speculators, and New Englanders against unpopular British
                    policies. These groups, angered by British taxation policies, forged
                    revolutionary alliances with other colonists.

Korean War and Japan’s Recovery






Milestones: 1945–1952








Korean War and Japan’s Recovery
As the Cold War came to dominate U.S. foreign policy, America extended security
                    commitments to two nations in Northeast Asia—the Republic of Korea and Japan.
                    The Department of State under Secretary Dean Acheson
                    forged a series of agreements to build a permanent American presence in the
                    region and support these two nations, creating alliances that have lasted to
                    today. 

The 25th Infantry Division prepares to go to Korean War from Japan

After Japan’s unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers in August 1945, the
                    United States military occupied the defeated nation and began a series of
                    far-reaching reforms designed to build a peaceful and democratic Japan by
                    reducing the power of the military and breaking up the largest Japanese business
                    conglomerates. However, growing concern over Communist power in East Asia,
                    particularly the success of the
                        Chinese Communist Party in its struggle against Chiang
                        Kai-shek’s Nationalist forces, led the United States to halt
                    reforms in 1947 and 1948 in order to focus on the economic recovery and
                    political rehabilitation of Japan. In this “Reverse Course,” Supreme Commander
                    of the Allied Powers, General Douglas MacArthur, focused on
                    strengthening, not punishing, what would become a key cold war ally. 
The growing concern over Japanese security related directly to war in Korea.
                    During World War II the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to temporarily
                    divide Korea at the 38th parallel in order oversee the removal of Japanese
                    forces. It soon became clear, however, that neither of the cold war antagonists
                    would permit its Korea ally to be threatened by unification. The Soviets
                    supported Kim Il Song in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in the north;
                    the United States backed Syngman Rhee in the Republic of Korea in the south.
                    Nevertheless the United States did not make Korea a key part of its defensive
                    strategy for East Asia, and American forces withdrew from the south in the late
                    1940s. Assuming that the United States did not consider South Korea of vital
                    interest, Kim’s army attacked the South in June 1950 almost conquering the
                    entire peninsula. The U.S. military returned, leading a United
                    Nations-authorized force to push the North’s army back above the 38th parallel
                    and beyond. After the People’s Republic of China entered the war in late 1950,
                    the Department of State worked to isolate Peking and maintain the unity of the
                    U.S.-led coalition. Only in 1953 did the two sides reach an uneasy truce, thus
                    crystallizing the division between North and South that exists today. In 1953
                    the United States and South Korea signed a mutual security treaty designed to
                    protect this new nation from its neighbor to the north.
U.S. efforts to save South Korea from Communist invasion accelerated Department
                    of State attempts to restore Japan to a respected international position, and
                    make that country a prosperous ally of the United States. Negotiated primarily
                    by John Foster
                        Dulles in 1950 and 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco ended the state
                    of war between Japan and 47 of the Allies (most nations allied with the Soviet
                    Union refused to sign), concluded the American Occupation, and excused the
                    Japanese from reparations for the war. Acheson signed the San Francisco Treaty
                    on September 8, 1951, the same day he and Japanese Prime Minister
                        Yoshida Shigeru signed the United States-Japanese
                    Security Treaty. The treaty allowed the United States to station troops in
                    Japan, and made the Japanese islands into an important facet of America’s global
                    containment structure. To American leaders, Japan has transformed from World War
                    II enemy to vital ally, and Korea went from a peripheral region to a key battle
                    ground in the Cold War.

The Australia, New Zealand and United States Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty),

Milestones: 1945–1952








The Australia, New Zealand and United States Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty),
                        1951

The Australia, New Zealand and
                        United States Security Treaty, or ANZUS Treaty, was
                    an agreement signed in 1951 to protect the security of the
                        Pacific. Although the agreement has not been formally
                    abrogated, the United States and New Zealand no longer maintain the security
                    relationship between their countries.

Secretary of State Dean Acheson speaking at an ANZUS Conference

At the onset of the Second World War, both Australia and New Zealand were members
                    of the British Empire, so when Britain entered the conflict they did as well.
                    During the course of the war, these two geographically isolated nations faced
                    the threat of direct attack for the first time in their histories as modern
                    states. As the Japanese expanded south into the Pacific Ocean, mainland
                    Australia and especially the city of Darwin suffered frequent Japanese air raids
                    in 1942 and 1943. After the sudden fall of the strategically important British
                    colony of Singapore to the Japanese on February 15, 1942, the Antipodean nations
                    expressed concern that the British Government was too focused on the war in
                    Europe to protect its colonies properly and they began for the first time to
                    look to the United States to help ensure their security. 
As the other Allied powers turned their attention to the reconstruction of
                    postwar Europe and Japan in the post World War II era, the governments of
                    Australia and New Zealand remained concerned about the possibility of future
                    Japanese expansionism and grew apprehensive about the rise of communism,
                    particularly in East Asia. Even before the war ended, Australia and New Zealand
                    signed an agreement stating that they had common goals and would work together
                    in the international arena; at the time, the agreement was for both nations the
                    first treaty negotiated independently, and it reflected the concern that the
                    major powers of the United States and the United Kingdom may not take Australian
                    and New Zealander issues into account in their postwar planning. The signing of
                    the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, in which the United Kingdom, Canada, and the
                    United States alongside the Western European powers committed to a mutual
                    defense arrangement, further prompted the geographically distant countries of
                    Australia and New Zealand to seek their own security guarantee and means of
                    integration in the international system in the postwar order. 
Australia initially considered the idea of a regional pact in the Pacific in the
                    1930s, and in 1946, at a meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, it
                    suggested that the major powers of the British Commonwealth form a regional
                    defense system. If such an organization were created, the members could then
                    invite the United States and other countries with strong interests in the
                    Pacific to join. At that time, however, the United States was not yet prepared
                    to commit itself to formal security arrangements in the Pacific. During the late
                    1940s, the United States was heavily engaged in the rebuilding of Japan, but the
                    United States did not extend its defense interests far beyond Japanese territory
                    before the Korean War. In response to Australian suggestions for a regional
                    coalition, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson
                    stated that formal treaties with the South Pacific nations were unnecessary, as
                    any real attack on Australia or New Zealand would elicit a U.S. response even
                    without formal treaties in place to guarantee it. Moreover, the situations in
                    the Atlantic and the Pacific were quite different, so there was no question of
                    simply creating a “Pacific Treaty Organization” to parallel NATO. The Pacific
                    Ocean was much larger, and the nations that bordered it were far more culturally
                    and linguistically diverse than the nations of the North Atlantic. Other
                    considerations led the United States to hesitate to commit to a regional
                    organization in the Pacific as well. A number of the countries in Southeast Asia
                    were still under colonial rule, or in the process of developing as independent
                    states, and therefore neither they nor their colonial governments were in a
                    position to make regional security commitments. At this time, the United States
                    was also faced with the critical situation in Europe, including the occupation
                    and support of West Germany and West Berlin and facing what it saw as the Soviet
                    threat on that continent. There were fewer immediate economic or political
                    threats to force equal attention to the security of the Southwest Pacific. 
Several developments in Asia between 1949 and 1951 helped to change U.S.
                    perceptions about the utility of a formal security arrangement. The communist
                    victory in the Chinese Revolution in 1949 seemed to confirm fears that communism
                    was spreading in East Asia as well as in Europe. In 1950s, the outbreak of the
                    Korean War led Australia and New Zealand to commit troops through the United
                    Nations and alongside the NATO allies, demonstrating both their concern over the
                    threat of communism and their commitment to doing their part to help contain it
                    in the region. Most importantly, the U.S. decision to end the occupation of
                    Japan and seek a peace treaty was met with great suspicion and disapproval from
                    officials in the South Pacific, and that made the United States more willing to
                    develop a security treaty to gain Antipodean support for the final peace
                    agreement. In April of 1951, U.S. President Harry Truman
                    announced that negotiations on a tripartite security treaty between the United
                    States, Australia and New Zealand would occur concurrently with the negotiations
                    for a final peace treaty with Japan. Both treaties were concluded in mid-1951,
                    and the ANZUS Treaty was ratified by the United States and entered into force in
                    1952. 
Although Britain also maintained an obligation to help defend Australian and New
                    Zealander security as the leader of the Commonwealth, it was not invited to join
                    the agreement. There were several reasons for the omission. One important
                    concern was that extending the invitation to Britain would have required the
                    signatories to open the opportunity to other European powers with colonial
                    interests in the region. Another was the fact that British forces were already
                    engaged in Europe and the Middle East, not to mention committed to the rest of
                    the Commonwealth, making their actual intervention in the South Pacific in the
                    event of a security crisis unlikely. Britain was also dealing with internal
                    instability in its Asian colonies, including Malaya and Hong Kong, and that made
                    the United States reluctant to sign an agreement that might obligate it to step
                    in to resolve British colonial concerns. In any case, the British were already
                    committed to U.S. security via NATO and to Australia and New Zealand via the
                    Commonwealth, so its participation in a Pacific security arrangement with the
                    United States, Australia, and New Zealand would have been somewhat redundant.
                    All parties assumed that if the ANZUS Treaty was eventually extended to include
                    other powers, however, the United Kingdom would be among the first to join. 
Although ANZUS was never expanded, the 1954 creation of the Southeast Asian
                    Treaty Organization (SEATO) included all of the ANZUS powers, as well as
                    Britain, France, and several other Asian powers, eliminating the impetus to
                    change the foundation of the ANZUS Treaty. Over the course of the decades that
                    followed the signing of the ANZUS Treaty, the members met annually to discuss
                    their shared interests and concerns. These concerns increasingly focused on the
                    spread of communism rather than the potential for Japanese militarization. Both
                    Australia and New Zealand sent forces to support the U.S. effort in Vietnam,
                    though without formally invoking the treaty. 
In 1984, the ANZUS Treaty began to unravel when New Zealand declared its country
                    a nuclear-free zone and refused to allow U.S. nuclear-powered submarines to
                    visit its ports. Two years later, U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
                    Australian Foreign Minister Bill Hayden concluded a series of bilateral talks by
                    confirming that their countries would continue to honor their obligations to one
                    another under the ANZUS Treaty, in spite of the fact that the trilateral aspects
                    of the Treaty had been halted. On September 17, 1986, the United States
                    suspended its treaty obligations toward New Zealand.

348. Memorandum From the President’s Assistant for National Security
                            Affairs (Brzezinski) to President Carter

Washington, undated

Source:
                                Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material,
                                Country File, Box 45, Folder: Latin America, 1–8/77. Confidential.
                                Sent for action. Printed from an uninitialed copy. Although no
                                drafting information appears on the memorandum, Pastor forwarded a draft to
                                Brzezinski on April 26, noting that it had been “written in response
                                to your request for short three-five page, medium to long-term,
                                political and/or economic analyses.” “As you may recall,” he added,
                                “you approved my request to write an analysis on the Caribbean in
                                late-February, but only now have I had the opportunity to write it.
                                In some ways, the time for such an analysis is not only opportune,
                                but urgent. The other day, I heard that Ray Marshall and Griffin Bell are apparently proposing a $100 million
                                plan for the Caribbean to deal with the illegal alien issue in just
                                the piecemeal and haphazard manner which I criticize directly in my
                                paper.” In a marginal comment, Inderfurth suggested circulating the memorandum to
                                    “Hormats and Hansen before submission to the
                                President.” Aaron agreed and
                                instructed Inderfurth to
                                “return to Pastor and
                                circulate.” (Ibid.) Hansen’s

Decolonization of Asia and Africa, 1945–1960






Milestones: 1945–1952








Decolonization of Asia and Africa, 1945–1960

Between 1945 and 1960, three dozen new states in Asia and
                        Africa achieved autonomy or outright independence
                    from their European colonial rulers.

Harold MacMillan, British Prime Minister, helped begin
                        decolonization

There was no one process of decolonization. In some areas, it was peaceful, and
                    orderly. In many others, independence was achieved only after a protracted
                    revolution. A few newly independent countries acquired stable governments almost
                    immediately; others were ruled by dictators or military juntas for decades, or
                    endured long civil wars. Some European governments welcomed a new relationship
                    with their former colonies; others contested decolonization militarily. The
                    process of decolonization coincided with the new Cold War between the Soviet
                    Union and the United States, and with the early development of the new United
                    Nations. Decolonization was often affected by superpower competition, and had a
                    definite impact on the evolution of that competition. It also significantly
                    changed the pattern of international relations in a more general sense.
The creation of so many new countries, some of which occupied strategic
                    locations, others of which possessed significant natural resources, and most of
                    which were desperately poor, altered the composition of the United Nations and
                    political complexity of every region of the globe. In the mid to late 19th
                    century, the European powers colonized much of Africa and Southeast Asia. During
                    the decades of imperialism, the industrializing powers of Europe viewed the
                    African and Asian continents as reservoirs of raw materials, labor, and
                    territory for future settlement. In most cases, however, significant development
                    and European settlement in these colonies was sporadic. However, the colonies
                    were exploited, sometimes brutally, for natural and labor resources, and
                    sometimes even for military conscripts. In addition, the introduction of
                    colonial rule drew arbitrary natural boundaries where none had existed before,
                    dividing ethnic and linguistic groups and natural features, and laying the
                    foundation for the creation of numerous states lacking geographic, linguistic,
                    ethnic, or political affinity.
During World War II Japan, itself a significant imperial power, drove the
                    European powers out of Asia. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, local
                    nationalist movements in the former Asian colonies campaigned for independence
                    rather than a return to European colonial rule. In many cases, as in Indonesia
                    and French Indochina, these nationalists had been guerrillas fighting the
                    Japanese after European surrenders, or were former members of colonial military
                    establishments. These independence movements often appealed to the United States
                    Government for support.
While the United States generally supported the concept of national
                    self-determination, it also had strong ties to its European allies, who had
                    imperial claims on their former colonies. The Cold War only served to complicate
                    the U.S. position, as U.S. support for decolonization was offset by American
                    concern over communist expansion and Soviet strategic ambitions in Europe.
                    Several of the NATO allies asserted that their colonial possessions provided
                    them with economic and military strength that would otherwise be lost to the
                    alliance. Nearly all of the United States’ European allies believed that after
                    their recovery from World War II their colonies would finally provide the
                    combination of raw materials and protected markets for finished goods that would
                    cement the colonies to Europe. Whether or not this was the case, the alternative
                    of allowing the colonies to slip away, perhaps into the United States’ economic
                    sphere or that of another power, was unappealing to every European government
                    interested in postwar stability. Although the U.S. Government did not force the
                    issue, it encouraged the European imperial powers to negotiate an early
                    withdrawal from their overseas colonies. The United States granted independence
                    to the Philippines in 1946.
However, as the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union came to dominate U.S.
                    foreign policy concerns in the late 1940s and 1950s, the Truman and Eisenhower
                    Administrations grew increasingly concerned that as the European powers lost
                    their colonies or granted them independence, Soviet-supported communist parties
                    might achieve power in the new states. This might serve to shift the
                    international balance of power in favor of the Soviet Union and remove access to
                    economic resources from U.S. allies. Events such as the Indonesian struggle for
                    independence from the Netherlands (1945–50), the Vietnamese war against France
                    (1945–54), and the nationalist and professed socialist takeovers of Egypt (1952)
                    and Iran (1951) served to reinforce such fears, even if new governments did not
                    directly link themselves to the Soviet Union. Thus, the United States used aid
                    packages, technical assistance and sometimes even military intervention to
                    encourage newly independent nations in the Third World to adopt governments that
                    aligned with the West. The Soviet Union deployed similar tactics in an effort to
                    encourage new nations to join the communist bloc, and attempted to convince
                    newly decolonized countries that communism was an intrinsically non-imperialist
                    economic and political ideology. Many of the new nations resisted the pressure
                    to be drawn into the Cold War, joined in the “nonaligned movement,” which formed
                    after the Bandung conference of 1955, and focused on internal development.
The newly independent nations that emerged in the 1950s and the 1960s became an
                    important factor in changing the balance of power within the United Nations. In
                    1946, there were 35 member states in the United Nations; as the newly
                    independent nations of the “third world” joined the organization, by 1970
                    membership had swelled to 127. These new member states had a few characteristics
                    in common; they were non-white, with developing economies, facing internal
                    problems that were the result of their colonial past, which sometimes put them
                    at odds with European countries and made them suspicious of European-style
                    governmental structures, political ideas, and economic institutions. These
                    countries also became vocal advocates of continuing decolonization, with the
                    result that the UN Assembly was often ahead of the Security Council on issues of
                    self-governance and decolonization. The new nations pushed the UN toward
                    accepting resolutions for independence for colonial states and creating a
                    special committee on colonialism, demonstrating that even though some nations
                    continued to struggle for independence, in the eyes of the international
                    community, the colonial era was ending.

NSC-68, 1950






Milestones: 1945–1952








NSC-68, 1950

National Security Council Paper NSC-68 (entitled “United States Objectives and
                    Programs for National Security” and frequently referred to as NSC-68) was a
                    Top-Secret report completed by the U.S. Department of State’s Policy Planning
                    Staff on April 7, 1950. The 58-page memorandum is among the most influential
                    documents composed by the U.S. Government during the Cold War, and was not
                    declassified until 1975. Its authors argued that one of the most pressing
                    threats confronting the United States was the “hostile design” of the Soviet
                    Union. The authors concluded that the Soviet threat would soon be greatly
                    augmented by the addition of more weapons, including nuclear weapons, to the
                    Soviet arsenal. They argued that the best course of action was to respond in
                    kind with a massive build-up of the U.S. military and its weaponry.

President Truman meeting with the NSC Staff

Reeling from the recent victory of Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War and
                    the successful detonation of an atomic weapon by the Soviet Union, Secretary of
                    State Dean
                        Acheson asked the Policy Planning Staff, led by Paul Nitze, to
                    undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. national security strategy. Building
                    upon the conclusions of an earlier National Security Council paper (NSC-20/4),
                    the authors of NSC-68 based their conclusions on the theory that the decline of
                    the Western European powers and Japan following World War II had left the United
                    States and the Soviet Union as the two dominant powers. Nitze’s group argued
                    that the Soviet Union was “animated by a new fanatic faith” antithetical to that
                    of the United States, and was driven “to impose its absolute authority over the
                    rest of the world.” Furthermore, they concluded that “violent and non-violent”
                    conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union had become
                    “endemic.”
NSC-68 outlined a variety of possible courses of action, including a return to
                    isolationism; war; continued diplomatic efforts to negotiate with the Soviets;
                    or “the rapid building up of the political, economic, and military strength of
                    the free world.” This last approach would allow the United States to attain
                    sufficient strength to deter Soviet aggression. In the event that an armed
                    conflict with the Communist bloc did arise, the United States could then
                    successfully defend its territory and overseas interests.
The authors of NSC-68 rejected a renewal of U.S. isolationism, fearing that this
                    would lead to the Soviet domination of Eurasia, and leave the United States
                    marooned on the Western Hemisphere, cut off from the allies and resources it
                    needed to fend off further Soviet encroachments. The report also ruled out a
                    preventive strike against the Soviet Union, because its authors reckoned that
                    such action would not destroy the Soviet military’s offensive capacities, and
                    would instead invite retaliatory strikes that would devastate Western Europe.
                    Moreover, U.S. experts did not believe that American public opinion would
                    support measures that might lead to a protracted war. NSC-68 did not rule out
                    the prospect of negotiating with the Soviet Union when it suited the objectives
                    of the United States and its allies; however, the report’s authors argued that
                    such an approach would only succeed if the United States could create “political
                    and economic conditions in the free world” sufficient to deter the Soviet Union
                    from pursuing a military solution to the Cold War rivalry.
NSC-68 concluded that the only plausible way to deter the Soviet Union was for
                    President Harry Truman to support a massive build-up of both conventional and
                    nuclear arms. More specifically, such a program should seek to protect the
                    United States and its allies from Soviet land and air attacks, maintain lines of
                    communications, and enhance the technical superiority of the United States
                    through “an accelerated exploitation of [its] scientific potential.” In order to
                    fund the substantial increase in military spending this conclusion demanded, the
                    report suggested that the Government increase taxes and reduce other
                    expenditures.
Initially, a number of U.S. officials strongly opposed NSC-68’s recommendations.
                    Critics such as Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, and senior diplomats such as
                    Soviet experts and former ambassadors to the Soviet Union George Kennan
                    and Charles
                        Bohlen, argued that the United States already had a substantial
                    military advantage over the Soviet Union. Kennan, in particular, disagreed with
                    Nitze’s assertion that the Soviet Union was bent on achieving domination through
                    force of arms, and argued that the United States could contain the Soviet Union
                    through political and economic measures, rather than purely military ones.
                    However, the invasion of South Korea by Soviet and Chinese-backed North Korean
                    forces in June 1950, and continuing charges by Congressional critics that the
                    Administration was soft on Communism, quickly settled matters in favor of the
                    report’s recommendations. NSC 68’s recommendations thereby became policy, and
                    the United States Government began a massive military build-up. While NSC-68 did
                    not make any specific recommendations regarding the proposed increase in defense
                    expenditures, the Truman Administration almost tripled defense spending as a
                    percentage of the gross domestic product between 1950 and 1953 (from 5 to 14.2
                    percent).

The Chinese Revolution of 1949






Milestones: 1945–1952








The Chinese Revolution of 1949

On October 1, 1949, Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong
                    declared the creation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The announcement
                    ended the costly full-scale civil war between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
                    and the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT), which broke out immediately
                    following World War II and had been preceded by on and off conflict between the
                    two sides since the 1920’s. The creation of the PRC also completed the long
                    process of governmental upheaval in China begun by the Chinese Revolution of 1911.
                    The “fall” of mainland China to communism in 1949 led the United States to
                    suspend diplomatic ties with the PRC for decades.

Communists entering Beijing in 1949.

The Chinese Communist Party, founded in 1921 in Shanghai,
                    originally existed as a study group working within the confines of the First
                    United Front with the Nationalist Party. Chinese Communists joined with the
                    Nationalist Army in the Northern Expedition of 1926–27 to rid the nation of the
                    warlords that prevented the formation of a strong central government. This
                    collaboration lasted until the “White Terror” of 1927, when the Nationalists
                    turned on the Communists, killing them or purging them from the party.
After the Japanese invaded
                        Manchuria in 1931, the Government of the Republic of China (ROC) faced
                    the triple threat of Japanese invasion, Communist uprising, and warlord
                    insurrections. Frustrated by the focus of the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek
                    on internal threats instead of the Japanese assault, a group of generals
                    abducted Chiang in 1937 and forced him to reconsider cooperation with the
                    Communist army. As with the first effort at cooperation between the Nationalist
                    government and the CCP, this Second United Front was short-lived. The
                    Nationalists expended needed resources on containing the Communists, rather than
                    focusing entirely on Japan, while the Communists worked to strengthen their
                    influence in rural society.
During World War II, popular support for the Communists increased. U.S. officials
                    in China reported a dictatorial suppression of dissent in Nationalist-controlled
                    areas. These undemocratic polices combined with wartime corruption made the
                    Republic of China Government vulnerable to the Communist threat. The CCP, for
                    its part, experienced success in its early efforts at land reform and was lauded
                    by peasants for its unflagging efforts to fight against the Japanese
                    invaders.

Chiang Kai-shek

Japanese surrender set the stage for the resurgence of civil war in China. Though
                    only nominally democratic, the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek
                    continued to receive U.S. support both as its former war ally and as the sole
                    option for preventing Communist control of China. U.S. forces flew tens of
                    thousands of Nationalist Chinese troops into Japanese-controlled territory and
                    allowed them to accept the Japanese surrender. The Soviet Union, meanwhile,
                    occupied Manchuria and only pulled out when Chinese Communist forces were in
                    place to claim that territory.
In 1945, the leaders of the Nationalist and Communist parties, Chiang Kai-shek
                    and Mao Zedong, met for a series of talks on the formation of a post-war
                    government. Both agreed on the importance of democracy, a unified military, and
                    equality for all Chinese political parties. The truce was tenuous, however, and,
                    in spite of repeated efforts by U.S. General George
                        Marshall to broker an agreement, by 1946 the two sides were
                    fighting an all-out civil war. Years of mistrust between the two sides thwarted
                    efforts to form a coalition government.
As the civil war gained strength from 1947 to 1949, eventual Communist victory
                    seemed more and more likely. Although the Communists did not hold any major
                    cities after World War II, they had strong grassroots support, superior military
                    organization and morale, and large stocks of weapons seized from Japanese
                    supplies in Manchuria. Years of corruption and mismanagement had eroded popular
                    support for the Nationalist Government. Early in 1947, the ROC Government was
                    already looking to the island province of Taiwan, off the coast of Fujian
                    Province, as a potential point of retreat. Although officials in the Truman
                    Administration were not convinced of the strategic importance to the United
                    States of maintaining relations with Nationalist China, no one in the U.S.
                    Government wanted to be charged with facilitating the “loss” of China to
                    communism. Military and financial aid to the floundering Nationalists continued,
                    though not at the level that Chiang Kai-shek would have liked. In October of
                    1949, after a string of military victories, Mao Zedong proclaimed the
                    establishment of the PRC; Chiang and his forces fled to Taiwan to regroup and
                    plan for their efforts to retake the mainland.
The ability of the PRC and the United States to find common ground in the wake of
                    the establishment of the new Chinese state was hampered by both domestic
                    politics and global tensions. In August of 1949, the Truman administration
                    published the “China White Paper,” which explained past U.S. policy toward China
                    based upon the principle that only Chinese forces could determine the outcome of
                    their civil war. Unfortunately for Truman, this step failed to protect his
                    administration from charges of having “lost” China. The unfinished nature of the
                    revolution, leaving a broken and exiled but still vocal Nationalist Government
                    and Army on Taiwan, only heightened the sense among U.S. anti-communists that
                    the outcome of the struggle could be reversed. The outbreak of the Korean War,
                    which pitted the PRC and the United States on opposite sides of an international
                    conflict, ended any opportunity for accommodation between the PRC and the United
                    States. Truman’s desire to prevent the Korean conflict from spreading south led
                    to the U.S. policy of protecting the Chiang Kai-shek government on Taiwan.
For more than twenty years after the Chinese revolution of 1949, there were few
                    contacts, limited trade and no diplomatic ties between the two countries. Until the 1970s, the United States
                    continued to recognize the Republic of China, located on Taiwan, as China’s true
                    government and supported that government’s holding the Chinese seat in the
                    United Nations.

Milestones

1945-1952

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (The
                    McCarran-Walter Act)






Milestones: 1945–1952








The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (The
                    McCarran-Walter Act)
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 upheld the national origins quota
                    system established by the Immigration Act of 1924, reinforcing this
                    controversial system of immigrant selection.

Patrick McCarran

It also ended Asian exclusion from immigrating to the United States and
                    introduced a system of preferences based on skill sets and family reunification.
                    Situated in the early years of the Cold War, the debate over the revision of
                    U.S. immigration law demonstrated a division between those interested in the
                    relationship between immigration and foreign policy, and those linking
                    immigration to concerns over national security. The former group, led by
                    individuals like Democrat Congressman from New York Emanuel
                        Celler, favored the liberalization of immigration laws. Celler
                    expressed concerns that the restrictive quota system heavily favored immigration
                    from Northern and Western Europe and therefore created resentment against the
                    United States in other parts of the world. He felt the law created the sense
                    that Americans thought people from Eastern Europe as less desirable and people
                    from Asia inferior to those of European descent. The latter group, led by
                    Democratic Senator from Nevada Pat McCarran and Democratic
                    Congressman from Pennsylvania Francis Walter, expressed
                    concerns that the United States could face communist infiltration through
                    immigration and that unassimilated aliens could threaten the foundations of
                    American life. To these individuals, limited and selective immigration was the
                    best way to ensure the preservation of national security and national interests. 
Remarkably, economic factors were relatively unimportant in the debate over the
                    new immigration provisions. Although past arguments in favor of restrictionism
                    focused on the needs of the American economy and labor force, in 1952, the Cold
                    War seemed to take precedent in the discussion. Notably, the American Federation
                    of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations took opposite sides in the
                    debate, demonstrating that there was not one, clear pro-labor position. 
At the basis of the Act was the continuation and codification of the National
                    Origins Quota System. It revised the 1924 system to allow
                    for national quotas at a rate of one-sixth of one percent of each nationality’s
                    population in the United States in 1920. As a result, 85 percent of the 154,277
                    visas available annually were allotted to individuals of northern and western
                    European lineage. The Act continued the practice of not including countries in
                    the Western Hemisphere in the quota system, though it did introduce new length
                    of residency requirements to qualify for quota-free entry. 
The 1952 Act created symbolic opportunities for Asian immigration, though in
                    reality it continued to discriminate against them. The law repealed the last of
                    the existing measures to exclude Asian immigration, allotted each Asian nation a
                    minimum quota of 100 visas each year, and eliminated laws preventing Asians from
                    becoming naturalized American citizens. Breaking down the “Asiatic Barred Zone”
                    was a step toward improving U.S. relations with Asian nations. At the same time,
                    however, the new law only allotted new Asian quotas based on race, instead of
                    nationality. An individual with one or more Asian parent, born anywhere in the
                    world and possessing the citizenship of any nation, would be counted under the
                    national quota of the Asian nation of his or her ethnicity or against a generic
                    quota for the “Asian Pacific Triangle.” Low quota numbers and a uniquely racial
                    construction for how to apply them ensured that total Asian immigration after
                    1952 would remain very limited. 
There were other positive changes to the implementation of immigration policy in
                    the 1952 Act. One was the creation of a system of preferences which served to
                    help American consuls abroad prioritize visa applicants in countries with
                    heavily oversubscribed quotas. Under the preference system, individuals with
                    special skills or families already resident in the United States received
                    precedence, a policy still in use today. Moreover, the Act gave non-quota status
                    to alien husbands of American citizens (wives had been entering outside of the
                    quota system for several years by 1952) and created a labor certification
                    system, designed to prevent new immigrants from becoming unwanted competition
                    for American laborers. 
President Truman was concerned about the decisions to
                    maintain the national origins quota system and to establish racially constructed
                    quotas for Asian nations. He thought the new law was discriminatory, and he
                    vetoed it, but the law had enough support in Congress to pass over his veto.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 1949






Milestones: 1945–1952








North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 1949

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 by the United States,
                    Canada, and several Western European nations to provide collective security
                    against the Soviet Union.

Signing of the NATO Treaty

NATO was the first peacetime military alliance the United States entered into
                    outside of the Western Hemisphere. After the destruction of the Second World
                    War, the nations of Europe struggled to rebuild their economies and ensure their
                    security. The former required a massive influx of aid to help the war-torn
                    landscapes re-establish industries and produce food, and the latter required
                    assurances against a resurgent Germany or incursions from the Soviet Union. The
                    United States viewed an economically strong, rearmed, and integrated Europe as
                    vital to the prevention of communist expansion across the continent. As a
                    result, Secretary of State George Marshall proposed a program of large-scale
                    economic aid to Europe. The resulting European Recovery Program, or Marshall Plan, not only
                    facilitated European economic integration but promoted the idea of shared
                    interests and cooperation between the United States and Europe. Soviet refusal
                    either to participate in the Marshall Plan or to allow its satellite states in
                    Eastern Europe to accept the economic assistance helped to reinforce the growing
                    division between east and west in Europe.
In 1947–1948, a series of events caused the nations of Western Europe to become
                    concerned about their physical and political security and the United States to
                    become more closely involved with European affairs. The ongoing civil war in
                    Greece, along with tensions in Turkey, led President Harry S. Truman to assert that the United States
                        would provide economic and military aid to both countries, as well as to any
                        other nation struggling against an attempt at subjugation. A
                    Soviet-sponsored coup in Czechoslovakia resulted in a communist government
                    coming to power on the borders of Germany. Attention also focused on elections
                    in Italy as the communist party had made significant gains among Italian voters.
                    Furthermore, events in Germany also caused concern. The occupation and governance
                    of Germany after the war had long been disputed, and in mid-1948, Soviet premier
                    Joseph Stalin chose to test Western resolve by implementing a blockade against
                    West Berlin, which was then under joint U.S., British, and French control but
                    surrounded by Soviet-controlled East Germany. This Berlin Crisis brought the
                    United States and the Soviet Union to the brink of conflict, although a massive
                    airlift to resupply the city for the duration of the blockade helped to prevent
                    an outright confrontation. These events caused U.S. officials to grow
                    increasingly wary of the possibility that the countries of Western Europe might
                    deal with their security concerns by negotiating with the Soviets. To counter
                    this possible turn of events, the Truman Administration considered the
                    possibility of forming a European-American alliance that would commit the United
                    States to bolstering the security of Western Europe.

Signing of the Brussels Treaty

The Western European countries were willing to consider a collective security
                    solution. In response to increasing tensions and security concerns,
                    representatives of several countries of Western Europe gathered together to
                    create a military alliance. Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and
                    Luxembourg signed the Brussels Treaty in March, 1948. Their treaty provided
                    collective defense; if any one of these nations was attacked, the others were
                    bound to help defend it. At the same time, the Truman Administration instituted
                    a peacetime draft, increased military spending, and called upon the historically
                    isolationist Republican Congress to consider a military alliance with Europe. In
                    May of 1948, Republican Senator Arthur H. Vandenburg
                    proposed a resolution suggesting that the President seek a security treaty with
                    Western Europe that would adhere to the United Nations charter but exist outside
                    of the Security Council where the Soviet Union held veto power. The Vandenburg
                    Resolution passed, and negotiations began for the North Atlantic Treaty.
In spite of general agreement on the concept behind the treaty, it took several
                    months to work out the exact terms. The U.S. Congress had embraced the pursuit
                    of the international alliance, but it remained concerned about the wording of
                    the treaty. The nations of Western Europe wanted assurances that the United
                    States would intervene automatically in the event of an attack, but under the
                    U.S. Constitution the power to declare war rested with Congress. Negotiations
                    worked toward finding language that would reassure the European states but not
                    obligate the United States to act in a way that violated its own laws.
                    Additionally, European contributions to collective security would require
                    large-scale military assistance from the United States to help rebuild Western
                    Europe’s defense capabilities. While the European nations argued for individual
                    grants and aid, the United States wanted to make aid conditional on regional
                    coordination. A third issue was the question of scope. The Brussels Treaty
                    signatories preferred that membership in the alliance be restricted to the
                    members of that treaty plus the United States. The U.S. negotiators felt there
                    was more to be gained from enlarging the new treaty to include the countries of
                    the North Atlantic, including Canada, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, and
                    Portugal. Together, these countries held territory that formed a bridge between
                    the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which would facilitate military
                    action if it became necessary.

                        Assistance Program

The result of these extensive negotiations was the signing of the North Atlantic
                    Treaty in 1949. In this agreement, the United States, Canada, Belgium, Denmark,
                    France, Iceland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the
                    United Kingdom agreed to consider attack against one an attack against all,
                    along with consultations about threats and defense matters. This collective
                    defense arrangement only formally applied to attacks against the signatories
                    that occurred in Europe or North America; it did not include conflicts in
                    colonial territories. After the treaty was signed, a number of the signatories
                    made requests to the United States for military aid. Later in 1949, President
                    Truman proposed a military assistance program, and the Mutual Defense Assistance
                    Program passed the U.S. Congress in October, appropriating some $1.4 billion
                    dollars for the purpose of building Western European defenses.
Soon after the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the outbreak
                    of the Korean War led the
                    members to move quickly to integrate and coordinate their defense forces through
                    a centralized headquarters. The North Korean attack on South Korea was widely
                    viewed at the time to be an example of communist aggression directed by Moscow,
                    so the United States bolstered its troop commitments to Europe to provide
                    assurances against Soviet aggression on the European continent. In 1952, the
                    members agreed to admit Greece and Turkey to NATO and added the Federal Republic
                    of Germany in 1955. West German entry led the Soviet Union to retaliate with its
                    own regional alliance, which took the form of the Warsaw Treaty
                        Organization and included the Soviet satellite states of Eastern
                    Europe as members.
The collective defense arrangements in NATO served to place the whole of Western
                    Europe under the American “nuclear umbrella.” In the 1950s, one of the first
                    military doctrines of NATO emerged in the form of “massive retaliation,” or the
                    idea that if any member was attacked, the United States would respond with a
                    large-scale nuclear attack. The threat of this form of response was meant to
                    serve as a deterrent against Soviet aggression on the continent. Although formed
                    in response to the exigencies of the developing Cold War, NATO has lasted beyond
                    the end of that conflict, with membership even expanding to include some former
                    Soviet states. It remains the largest peacetime military alliance in the
                    world.

The Arab-Israeli War of 1948






Milestones: 1945–1952








The Arab-Israeli War of 1948

The Arab-Israeli War of 1948 broke out when five Arab nations invaded territory
                    in the former Palestinian mandate immediately following the announcement of the
                    independence of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948. In 1947, and again on May
                    14, 1948, the United States had offered de facto recognition of the Israeli
                    Provisional Government, but during the war, the United States maintained an arms
                    embargo against all belligerents.

Raising the Flag signified the Conclusion of the Conflict

On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181
                    (also known as the Partition
                        Resolution) that would divide Great Britain’s former Palestinian
                    mandate into Jewish and Arab states in May 1948. Under the resolution, the area
                    of religious significance surrounding Jerusalem would remain under international
                    control administered by the United Nations. The Palestinian Arabs refused to
                    recognize this arrangement, which they regarded as favorable to the Jews and
                    unfair to the Arab population that would remain in Jewish territory under the
                    partition. The United States sought a middle way by supporting the United
                    Nations resolution, but also encouraging negotiations between Arabs and Jews in
                    the Middle East.
The United Nations resolution sparked conflict between Jewish and Arab groups
                    within Palestine. Fighting began with attacks by irregular bands of Palestinian
                    Arabs attached to local units of the Arab Liberation Army composed of volunteers
                    from Palestine and neighboring Arab countries. These groups launched their
                    attacks against Jewish cities, settlements, and armed forces. The Jewish forces
                    were composed of the Haganah, the underground militia of the Jewish community in
                    Palestine, and two small irregular groups, the Irgun, and LEHI. The goal of the
                    Arabs was initially to block the Partition Resolution and to prevent the
                    establishment of the Jewish state. The Jews, on the other hand, hoped to gain
                    control over the territory allotted to them under the Partition Plan.
After Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948, the fighting intensified
                    with other Arab forces joining the Palestinian Arabs in attacking territory in
                    the former Palestinian mandate. On the eve of May 14, the Arabs launched an air
                    attack on Tel Aviv, which the Israelis resisted. This action was followed by the
                    invasion of the former Palestinian mandate by Arab armies from Lebanon, Syria,
                    Iraq, and Egypt. Saudi Arabia sent a formation that fought under the Egyptian
                    command. British trained forces from Transjordan eventually intervened in the
                    conflict, but only in areas that had been designated as part of the Arab state
                    under the United Nations Partition Plan and the corpus separatum of Jerusalem.
                    After tense early fighting, Israeli forces, now under joint command, were able
                    to gain the offensive.
Though the United Nations brokered two cease-fires during the conflict, fighting
                    continued into 1949. Israel and the Arab states did not reach any formal
                    armistice agreements until February. Under separate agreements between Israel
                    and the neighboring states of Egypt, Lebanon, Transjordan, and Syria, these
                    bordering nations agreed to formal armistice lines. Israel gained some territory
                    formerly granted to Palestinian Arabs under the United Nations resolution in
                    1947. Egypt and Jordan retained control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
                    respectively. These armistice lines held until 1967. The United
                    States did not become directly involved with the armistice negotiations, but
                    hoped that instability in the Middle East would not interfere with the
                    international balance of power between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Under Secretaries of State for Arms Control and International Security
            Affairs







Under Secretaries of State for Arms Control and International Security
            Affairs


Congress, in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1971 (P.L. 92-226; 86 Stat. 28),
                authorized the President to appoint, with the advice and consent of the Senate, an
                officer for the purpose of coordinating the government’s security assistance
                programs. Under this act, the President has commissioned all incumbents as “Under
                Secretaries of State for Coordinating Security Assistance Programs.” Since then, the
                Department of State has assigned the position different functional designations. On
                Aug 22, 1977, the Department changed the designation from “Under Secretary for
                Security Assistance” to “Under Secretary for Security Assistance, Science, and
                Technology.” On Apr 30, 1990, the Department changed this designation to
                “International Security Affairs.” In addition to coordinating U.S. security
                assistance programs, duties associated with this position have also included at one
                time or another: nuclear non-proliferation; control of technology transfers and
                strategic goods; and coordination of international communications policy. Title
                changed to Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security
                Affairs on May 12, 1994.
