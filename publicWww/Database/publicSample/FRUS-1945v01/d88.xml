                            (Exec)
Minutes of the Second Meeting (Executive, Session) of the
                                United States Delegation, Held at Washington, Friday, March 23,
                                1943, 10 a.m.

[Informal Notes&#8212;Extracts]

[Here follows list of names of persons (14) present at meeting.]
[At the request of the Acting Secretary this meeting was declared off the
                                record.]9

Relation of Private Organizations to
                                the Conference

The Acting Secretary opened the meeting by
                            stating that Mr. Stettinius had
                            asked him to call this special meeting to discuss an important question
                            that had arisen in connection with the San Francisco Conference. &#8230;
The Acting Secretary said that the point to be
                            taken up at the Secretary&#8217;s request concerned the relation of private
                            organizations [Page 149]and groups in
                            this country to the San Francisco Conference. In this connection two
                            documents were distributed: Draft of Letter to be Sent to Various
                            Private National Organizations and a list entitled Private National
                                Organizations.10

The Acting Secretary pointed out that a great
                            number of private organizations and groups want to be represented in San
                            Francisco and that there were good reasons why many of them should be
                            there. However, it was felt to be unfortunate to overload the official
                            Delegation with such representatives, although the possibility had been
                            considered of recognizing official representatives of a number of these
                            organizations as official advisers to the Delegation. If this plan were
                            adopted, however, the Delegation Would reach tremendous proportions.
The Acting Secretary stated that the thought in
                            the Department now was that each organization named on the list of
                            private national organizations would send one representative to San
                            Francisco to be there for consultation as this might prove desirable.
                            These representatives would not be official members of the American
                            Delegation, but a full system of liaison would be set up to keep them
                            closely in touch with the progress of the work. The representatives
                            would be consulted from time to time as appropriate.
. . . . . . .
Senator Vandenberg urged that, if proper emphasis was
                            put upon the fact that the United Nations Conference at San Francisco
                            was to be a &#8220;peace-keeping&#8221; show and not a &#8220;peace-making&#8221; show, then a
                            large number of organizations seeking representation would not be
                            interested. Representative Eaton agreed that a clear
                            statement of what the Conference was to do would alleviate the
                            situation.
The Acting Secretary asked Mr. Hiss to note that a statement along the
                            lines suggested by Senator Vandenberg and Representative Eaton should be prepared.
. . . . . . .
At this point the meeting was adjourned to enable the Delegates to go to
                            the White House.11

. . . . . . .
The Acting Secretary asked Mr. MacLeish if he would be responsible for
                            drafting the statement under discussion. Mr.
                                    MacLeish asked
                            whether the decision taken by the Delegates implied that the number of
                            official advisers would be increased. There was general agreement that
                            this was not implied. Mr. MacLeish stated that he had one
                            thing further in mind which he thought should be emphasized: [Page 150]the people of this country, indeed the
                            people of the world had been invited to discuss the Dumbarton Oaks
                            Proposals and think about them. The statement that was now to be drawn
                            up, he felt, should not discourage them in any way from continuing to
                            discuss and to think about the Proposals, nor should it play down the
                            San Francisco Conference. In a real sense, he said, that Conference was
                            the people&#8217;s show. We would have to give the impression that they could
                            come to it yet not invite them&#8212;a difficult thing to do.
Senator Connally added that the statement should stress
                            the impracticality of delegates conferring with large numbers of
                            representatives due to their heavy duties and schedules. Representative Bloom agreed that the statement should not play
                            up the role of the people at the Conference at the expense of the
                            Delegates so that the Delegates would be unable to perform their primary
                            responsibilities at San Francisco.
. . . . . . .
The meeting was adjourned by the Acting Secretary at 12:30 p.m.
