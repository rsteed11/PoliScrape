The Acting Secretary of
                                    State to the Ambassador in the United Kingdom
                                (Winant)21


Washington, March 23,
                            1945&#8212;midnight.

2267. The Department has received from the League of Nations, the
                            Permanent Court of International Justice, the International Labor
                            Organization, the Interim Commission on Food and Agriculture, and the
                            United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration requests that
                            they be invited to send representatives to the United Nations Conference
                            at San Francisco. All these are inter-governmental organizations. There
                            have also been formal and informal inquiries from non-governmental
                            international organizations.
We believe that a clear distinction should be drawn between
                            intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental international
                            organizations. The latter should not be invited or encouraged to send
                            representatives, but no obstacles would be placed in the way of their
                            voluntarily sending representatives to San Francisco.
As regards inter-governmental organizations, the Department would
                            appreciate being advised whether the other sponsoring governments would
                            have any objection to this Government making arrangements for unofficial
                            representation at San Francisco of the above named organizations. Such
                            representation would be limited to not more than two or three persons
                            for each organization. These are organizations which will eventually be
                            liquidated or modified as a result of the creation of the proposed
                            United Nations organization or which may be brought into formal or
                            informal relationship with the new organization.
Please take this matter up with the Foreign Minister and inform the
                            Department as promptly as possible of his views concerning this
                            matter:
Repeated to Moscow and Chungking.22

Telegram&#8217;s
                                691 and 486, respectively. The Department was informed of the
                                Chinese and the British concurrence in the proposal in telegram 525,
                                March 28 from Chungking (500.CC/3&#8211;2845), and 3648, April 10, from
                                London (500.CC/4&#8211;1045). In telegram 999, April 1, 1 p.m., from
                                Moscow, Ambassador Harriman
                                reported: &#8220;Molotov has
                                written me under date of March 31 to effect that Soviet Government
                                agrees to participation of non-official representatives of the
                                inter-Governmental organizations set forth in Department&#8217;s 691,
                                March 23, midnight at San Francisco Conference. &#8230; He concludes that
                                Soviet Government also agrees with opinion of American Government
                                that non-Governmental international organizations should not be
                                invited to San Francisco Conference.&#8221; (500.CC/4&#8211;145)&#8617;
