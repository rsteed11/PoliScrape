Principles for the Compilation and Editing of
                            &#8220;Foreign Relations&#8221;

The principles which guide the compilation and editing of Foreign Relations are stated in Department of State Regulation
                        1350 of June 15, 1961, a revision of the order approved on March 26, 1925,
                        by Mr. Frank B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The
                        text of the current regulation is printed below:
1350 Documentary Record of American
                            Diplomacy

1351 Scope of Documentation

The publication Foreign Relations of the United States,
                            Diplomatic Papers, constitutes the official record of the foreign
                        policy of the United States. These volumes include, subject to necessary
                        security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record
                        of the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of
                        State&#8217;s responsibilities, together with appropriate materials concerning the
                        facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. When further
                        material is needed to supplement the documentation in the Department&#8217;s files
                        for a proper understanding of the relevant policies of the United States,
                        such papers should be obtained from other Government agencies.[Page IV]
1352 Editorial Preparation

The basic documentary diplomatic record to be printed in Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic Papers, shall
                        be edited by the Historical Office, Bureau of Public Affairs of the
                        Department of State. The editing of the record shall be guided by the
                        principles of historical objectivity. There shall be no alteration of the
                        text, no deletions without indicating where in the text the deletion is
                        made, and no omission of facts which were of major importance in reaching a
                        decision. Nothing shall be omitted for the purpose of concealing or glossing
                        over what might be regarded by some as a defect of policy. However, certain
                        omissions of documents are permissible for the following reasons: 
a.

To avoid publication of matters which would tend to impede current
                                diplomatic negotiations or other business.
b.

To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless
                                details.
c.

To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by
                                individuals and by foreign governments.
d.

To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or
                                individuals.
e.

To eliminate personal opinions presented in despatches and not
                                acted upon by the Department. To this consideration there is one
                                qualification&#8212;in connection with major decisions it is desirable,
                                where possible, to show the alternatives presented to the Department
                                before the decision was made.

1353 Clearance

To obtain appropriate clearances of material to be published in Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic
                            Papers, the Historical Office shall: 
a.

Refer to the appropriate policy offices of the Department and of
                                other agencies of the Government such papers as appear to require
                                policy clearance.
b.

Refer to the appropriate foreign governments requests for
                                permission to print as part of the diplomatic correspondence of the
                                United States those previously unpublished documents which were
                                originated by the foreign governments.
