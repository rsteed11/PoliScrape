The Acting Secretary of
                                    State to the Ambassador in the United Kingdom
                                (Winant)12


Washington, March 23, 1945&#8212;noon.

2234. Gromyko recently called on
                            Mr. Dunn13 and informed him that the
                            Soviets were planning, in addition to their general delegation, to send
                            delegations to San Francisco representing White Russia and the Ukraine.
                            Mr. Dunn expressed surprise at
                            this telling the Ambassador that it did not follow the decisions reached
                            at Yalta as he understood them but as he had not been there he would
                            refer the whole matter to the Secretary.
The Secretary felt strongly that this was not in accordance with the
                            decisions reached at the Crimea and after talking this matter over with
                            the President,14 who also concurred, called
                                Gromyko in15 and told him very definitely that this went
                            beyond the Yalta decision and [Page 151]was entirely inconsistent with our understanding of it. The Secretary
                            told the Ambassador that he was basing his remarks on our records of
                            that Conference and that he was speaking for the President as well as
                            himself. The Secretary asked Gromyko to inform his Government of our feeling in this
                            matter which the Ambassador promised to do at once. The Secretary gained
                            the impression in his discussion with the Ambassador that he may not
                            have been requested by his Government to take this up officially with us
                            but that point is not certain.
For your own secret information what we did agree to at Yalta was that if
                            the Soviets should raise at San Francisco the question of these two
                            republics Becoming initial members of the organization that we would
                            support such a proposal. The British agreed to do likewise. The question
                            of the two republics being represented at San Francisco was actually
                            discussed at the Conference and a negative decision reached.16

The following is for your confidential information.
We have informed the British Embassy here of the action we have taken as
                            Mr. Eden had a similiar message
                            from Molotoff,17


Grew





The same message, with the exception of the
                                final two paragraphs, was transmitted by the Acting Secretary to the
                                Ambassador in the Soviet Union, for his information, in telegram
                                678, March 22, 11 p.m. The Secretary, in a telephone call of March
                                21 from &#8220;The Horseshoe&#8221;, had asked Mr. Lynch to have someone send a telegram to Moscow and
                                London with reference to his conversation with Mr. Gromyko the day
                            before.&#8617;

See memorandum by Assistant Secretary of State
                                    Dunn, March 17, p. 132.&#8617;

No record of conversation
                                found in Department files.&#8617;

No record found of conversation with Mr. Gromyko, which Mr. Stettinius indicated took place on
                                March 20. For memorandum of points to be made by the Secretary in
                                talking to Ambassador Gromyko, see Conferences at Malta and Yalta, p.
                                    991.&#8617;
