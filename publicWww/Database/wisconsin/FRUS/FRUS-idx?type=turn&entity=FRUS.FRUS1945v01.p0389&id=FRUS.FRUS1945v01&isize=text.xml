It was planned that\nthe President of the Conference would make the first speech and that\nthe Foreign Ministers of the sponsoring powers would follow in al-\nphabetical order. Mr. Eden wondered whether this would be wise\nand suggested the advisability of holding one or two of these speeches\nuntil later on so that a rebuttal, if necessary, can be made of the pro-\nposals raised. Mr. Hiss said that the publicity and radio people were\nvery anxious to have the Foreign Ministers of the sponsoring powers\nspeak on the first day. Mr. Eden acquiesced. It was agreed that the\nspeeches should be limited to around fifteen minutes. It was decided\nthat Mr. Hiss would prepare an agenda for the Foreign Ministers\nConference Meeting on Saturday.\n                           B. POLAND\n  Mr. Eden stated that he had just received a telegram from Moscow\nto the effect that since Harriman and Clark-Kerr had left, there was\nno longer the same urgency to deliver the message from the President\nand the Prime Minister to Stalin.22 He 23 and the American Ambas-\nsador had therefore agreed to delay action until Wednesday morning\nApril 18th to permit further changes to be made if the Prime Minister\nand Eden desired. If no word was received prior to that time they\nwould send to Stalin the original message agreed upon. Mr. Eden\nstated that two new events had occurred since discussing this pre-\nviously which might change our position. The first was that the\nRussians had informed us that they were about to sign a mutual\nassistance pact with the Lublin Government of Poland. The Secre-\ntary stated that we had received a cable to this effect 24 also, and was\ndisturbed by it. Mr. Eden said that the Russians had come out again\npublicly demanding that the Lublin Poles be represented at San\nFrancisco if no new government had been formed by that time.\nHe stated that Ambassador Clark-Kerr had urged very strongly\nagainst making any concessions whatever in our joint telegram as\nthe Russians would construe it as a sign of weakness. He thought\nthere was still time to make a change if it was decided that such a\nchange as Clark-Kerr had suggested was considered favorably.\n  The Secretary and Mr. Dunn both stated that they felt that no\nchange should be made- even though there might be time to do so.\nMr. Dunn stated that we had received a similar message from our\nEmbassy and had already telegraphed a reply instructing our Em-\nbassy to deliver the message as previously instructed.25 Mr. Dunn\nt See draft message from President Truman to the Ambassador in the Soviet\nUnion quoting text of the proposed joint message, vol. v, p. 219.\nS i.e., Ambassador Clark Kerr.\n"See telegram 1198, April 16, 7 p. mi., from Moscow, vol. v, p. 225.\n2 See telegram 882, April 16, 4 p. m., to Moscow, ibid.\n     723-681-67--25,\n327\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
