MR.\nSTE&#182;INrUS said this interpretation was satisfactory to him.\n  MR. DULLES stated that he concurred in the Ambassador's state-\nment so far as it related to Chapter XII-to conditions under the sur-\nrender terms. He did not think we should say, however, that the\nenemy states, for example Italy, forever had no right of appeal to the\nGeneral Assembly or the Security Council. AMBASSADOR Koo said\nthat this interpretation was agreeable to him and AMBASSADOR GRO--\nMYKO agreed that it was the right solution. AMBASSADOR GROMYKO\nstated that his understanding was that enemy states should not have\nthe right of appeal under the provisions in the Chapter on transitional\narrangements. MI. DEJEAN and AMBASSADOR HALIFAX agreed with\nthis statement.\n  AMBASSADOR GROMYKO indicated that the interpretation might pro-\nvide that enemy states should not have the right to appeal to the\nSecurity Council or the General Assembly as long as they were under\nthe special status imposed on them by the surrender terms or, alter--\n,natively, as long as they were subject to the control measures im--\nposed on them as enemy states.\n  MR. STEINIUS suggested that Mr. Johnson draft an interpretation\nto be submitted to the group for its consideration. He then asked\nif there were any other items to be raised at this time. MAli. BON_\nCOUR stated that Committee III/3, except for-the Greek amendment,\nwas finished with its work. He suggested that the Chairman of\n,Committee III/3 should be asked to read his report today so that\nit could go before the Commission. Otherwise, there would have to,\nbe another meeting of that Committee.\n  MR. STiErTINIus stated that a message should be immediately sent\nto Committee III/3 requesting that the report be read today and the\nwork of the Committee completed.\n  AMBASSADOR HALIFAX stated that there was one point which the\nSoviet Ambassador had brought to his notice that he thought should\nbe made at this time. It concerned the unsatisfactory nature of the\nreport in Committee III/1 on the veto chapter. He indicated that\nthere was considerable pressure in the Committee to have this section\nof the report redrafted to correspond more exactly with the develop-\nments in the Committee.4'\n  MR. WEBSTER stated that the report as it stood was quite unaccept-\nable to the British Delegation. An effort had been made to amend\nit. It had been moved that a Subcommittee be established to put the\ndraft in better form.
