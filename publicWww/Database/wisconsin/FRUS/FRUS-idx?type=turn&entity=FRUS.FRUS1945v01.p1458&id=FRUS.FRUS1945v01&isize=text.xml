MR. PASVOLSKY reiterated that there would be no sections in\nthe final Charter and therefore no importance whatsoever could be\nattached to the word "section." However, MR. PASVOLSKY declared\nthat the wording of the Molotov draft amounted in effect to saying\n"any organs provided for in the Charter."\n  DR. BOWMAN asked whether Mr. Pasvolsky had read the record\nof the previous day\'s meeting in the Penthouse and MR. PASVOLSKY\nreplied in the negative. DR. BOWMAN remarked it was important\nto remember that on the previous day Ambassador Gromyko had made\na statement on the subjects concerning which he wanted to have no\ndiscussion. The three categories he mentioned were immigration,\ntreaties, and agreements.7\' DR. BOWMAN pointed out that to exclude\na treaty from the scope of discussion of the General Assembly was\nto exclude the provisions of that treaty and its articles. Thus, parts\nof such agreements which were inconsistent with the objectives and\nprinciples of the Organization could not be discussed by the General\nAssembly under the draft proposed by Molotov. MiR.

MR. DULLES reiterated that there was a\ndifference between referring to the Charter and referring to its\norgans. DR. BOWMAN observed that the Russian rationalization was\nthat it would be nonsensical to permit the Organization to talk about\n"anything at all." It would have to talk about something specific\nand\nthe Russians had attempted to define the sphere of discussion nar-\nrowly.   REPRESENTATVE  BLOOM   commented   that Ambassador\nGromyko had appeared to regret having outlined the three categories\nof questions which he did not want to be discussed by the General\nAssembly and he had tried to minimize the importance of his state-\nment. MR. ARMSTRONG pointed out that Ambassador Gromyko had\nreferred to "immigration" previously.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY declared that the Coordinating Committee would\nhave to read every paragraph of the Charter to determine if the\nphraseology was consistent with the intent expressed in the Com-\nmittee discussions. If the Coordinating Committee was not sure that\n  "See minutes of the twenty-seventh Five-Power meeting, June 19, 8:45\np. m.,\np. 1382.\n  "Dmitry Z.
