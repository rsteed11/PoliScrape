General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 255\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nwould have been strengthened if there had been time to work out a\ndesirable formula. He suggested amending the text to read:\n  "The General Assembly should take action to bring about coordi-\nnation of the policies of international economic, social, cultural, and\nother specialized agencies\n  THE SECRETARY asked whether there were any objections to this\namendment and since there were none, he stated that it was approved.\n  New Paragraph.-MR. PASVOLSKY read the proposed New Para-\ngraph (for Section B) and said this had been discussed widely. [The\nGeneral Assembly should be empowered to act, within the limits of\nthe Charter, on matters of concern to the Organization which are not\nallocated to other agencies.] It was in the United States Proposals "I\nbefore the Dumbarton Oaks Conversations and had been left out in\ndrafting the Proposals because it had seemed undesirable to oyver-\nburden the Charter. However, the inclusion of such a provision\nregarding the residual power of the Organization strengthens the\nGeneral Assembly in appearance. Actually, the General Assembly\nhas this residual power anyhow.\n  THE SECRETARY thought that inclusion of the proposed new para-\ngraph would help with the small nations.\nSection C. Voting\n  Paragraph 1.-The group turned to consideration of Section C,\nand MR. PASVOLSKY read paragraph 1:\n  ["1. Each member of the Organization should have one vote in\nthe General Assembly."]\n  MR. DuLLEs commented that there was no provision for a Com-\nmittee on Credentials, and he thought it would be most important\nto have some procedure for passing on credentials of representatives,\nbecause of changing conditions. It would sometimes be necessary\nto decide whether a given state was independent or not and whether\nthe representatives who claimed the right to sit for that state were,\nin fact, entitled to do so. He thought it most important to state\nwho should pass on the eligibility of the -delegates, because there\nmight be a fluctuating situation.\n  iR. PASvOLSKY said that the General Assembly would have such\npower. In any case, it had the power to create the agencies it needed\nto discharge its functions. MR. DULLES said that the problem took\non special urgency because of the fact that the Soviet Russian Repub-\nlics had been given autonomy in foreign affairs. MR. PAsvoLsKY\nsaid that their status was rather a problem of membership than as\nquestion of powers of the General Assembly to seat delegates of\nmember states.\n18 For the United States tentative proposals for a General International\nOr-\nganization (II B 1.), July 18, 1944, see Foreign Relations, 1944, vol.
