If this were agreed to, the five texts might be ready.\nIn this case the proposal of Marshal Smuts, as amended by Ambassa-\ndor Koo, might be accepted. If a date were not fixed immediately\nfor a closing and if the language panels were not accepted, authenti-\ncation by the several delegations might take several weeks. MARSHAL\nSMurTS suggested fixing the date of Friday, June 22, such texts as\nwere ready to be signed at that time.\n  AMBASSADOR GRoMYKO said that he would agree to this if this were\nthe only practicable procedure....\n  MR. STErNIuS said that it was necessary for him to leave to meet\nan important engagement and that he would ask Ambassador\nGromyko to preside. He understood that there was general agree-\nment on the procedure suggested by Marshal Smuts, and amended\nby Ambassador Koo, that the Secretary-General would study the\nwhole procedure and present it to this group at a later date.\n  AMBASSADOR GRoMYmo took the chair and the Presidents of the\nthree Commissions withdrew from the meeting.\n  The first question under consideration was on domestic jurisdiction.\nAMBASSADOR GROMYKO said that the Chinese delegation had asked for\na further consideration of this question and asked Ambassador Koo\nto make a statement.\n  AMBASSADOR Koo recalled the discussion of the Five Powers at the\nmeeting last Wednesday,24 and the proposal by Lord Halifax.

Boncour had not been favorably\nimpressed with the suggestion to modify the Four-Power Amendment.\nThe only item in question was the last clause of the Four-Power\nAmendment, which provided that the domestic jurisdiction principle\nshould not prejudice the application of Chapter VIII, Section B, of\nthe Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. AMBASSADOR Koo said he under-\nstood that Lord Halifax\'s suggestion was to add the underscored\nwords "enforcement measures". AMBASSADOR GROMYKO thouglht the\nBritish proposal was to delete the clause and that the suggestion for\nthe addition of the words came from the Australian delegation.\nAMBASSADOR Koo said that it was the view of his delegation that the\nproposed addition would further enlarge the scope of the (domes-\ntic jurisdiction exception. His delegation was very much concerned\nabout the effect of this upon the enforcement action of the Coun-\ncil under Chapter VIII. They were concerned particularly as to\nwhether the term "enforcement measures" had reference only to para-\ngraphs 3 and 4 of Chapter VIII, B.
