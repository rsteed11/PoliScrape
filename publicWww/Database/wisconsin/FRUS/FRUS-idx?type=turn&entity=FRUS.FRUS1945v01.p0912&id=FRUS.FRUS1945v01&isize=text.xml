The text of Representative\nEaton\'s statement follows:\n  [Here follows text of statement substantially the same as that read\nin the fiftieth meeting (Executive Session) of the delegation, May 22,\nsupra.]\n  A\\T-. DULLES announced that the Belgian Delegate, Mr. Rolin, had\nabandoned the previous position of his government that there had to\nbe explicit provisions concerning withdrawal. Mr. Rolin had recom-\nmended that the proposal concerning prohibition of withdrawal be\nwithdrawn and that silence on the question be construed as indicating\nthat any nation had the right to withdraw if the Organization failed\nin its obligations. Mr. Rolin\'s statement was thought by the Delega-\ntion to constitute an almost complete acceptance of the position of\nthe United States on the subject. It read as follows:\n  [Here follows text of statement identical with document 528, 1/2/33,\nMay 23, UNCIO Documents, volume 7, page 87.]\n  Ma.

The\nSubcommittee had consented to reconsider these problems and voted\nunanimously to accept the word "educational."
