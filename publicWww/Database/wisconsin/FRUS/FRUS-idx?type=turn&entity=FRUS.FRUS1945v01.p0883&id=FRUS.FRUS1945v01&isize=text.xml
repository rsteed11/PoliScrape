General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 821\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONTFERENCE\nguard the right of the Security Council to investigate disputes as\ndefined in Section A, paragraph 1, and to safeguard the right of states\nto bring cases before the Assembly and the Council. SENATOR VAN-\nDENBERG said he could see no objection to this. MR. PASVOLSKY said\nit simply safeguarded the right of appeal to the World Organization\nas well as to regional organizations.\n  AR. ROCKEFELLER indicated that a similar amendment had been of-\nfered by the Latin Americans 38 and that Mr. Pasvolsky had objected\nto that amendment at that time. MR. PASVOLSKY remarked that the\nother amendment had involved a substantive change which contrasted\nwith the present one offered by the Soviet Union. He added, how-\never, that he did not like the addition particularly and did not think\nit was necessary. He thought he would try to talk the Soviet Union\nout of it. MR. STASSEN pointed out that in fact the addition did no\nharm. MR. ROCKEFELLER said the one difficulty with it was that the\nLatins might insist on re-introducing their proposal if this one was\naccepted. THE SECRETARY indicated that the Delegation's recom-\nmendation was then to have the paragraph eliminated if possible in\nthe course of the meeting at 5: 00 o'clock.\n            XOT!ING PROCEDURE IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL\n  SENATOR CONNALLY stated that in Committee III/3 strong opposi-\ntion was being expressed to the Yalta Agreement on voting and that\nthe going was tough.39  So far, he said, most of the discussion had\nbeen on what was meant by the Yalta Agreement on voting. He\nthen called on Mr. Johnson to report on the work of the Subcommittee\nthat had been set up to deal with this problem. MR. JOHNSON indi-\ncated that things had developed rather favorably. Mr. Blaisdell\nhad been selected head of the Subcommittee.40 A series of questions\nhad been prepared on which the four powers were being asked to\nconcert their reply. This procedure, he said, gave us time to get agree-\nment on our interpretation, the next committee meeting being on\nTuesday.41 He thought the matter had worked out quite well for\nour interests. THE SECRETARY suggested that we should realize that\nif there was any departure from the Yalta Agreement, the Soviet\nUnion would probably not sign the Charter.\n  38See summary notes on informal consultative meeting with certain Latin\nAmerican Ambassadors, May 14, p. 712.
