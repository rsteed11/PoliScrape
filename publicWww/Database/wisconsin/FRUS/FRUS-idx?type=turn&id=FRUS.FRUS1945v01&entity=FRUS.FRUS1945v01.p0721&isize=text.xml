General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 659\n\n\nUNITED NAXIONS CONFERENCE69\ncome from a meeting of the regional subcommittee (III/4) 55 at\nwhich the Colombian Delegate 56 had eloquently and clearly pressed\nhis case for a regional exemption in this hemisphere. MR. STASSEN\nreported that it was a perfect plea for, hemispheric isolation. The\nColombian Delegate had stated that a regional arrangement in the\nWestern Hemisphere was better than the general organization as a\nmeans of preserving security. Under this system, responsibility is\nplaced on the regional system to take action to maintain peace. He&gt;\nhad pointed out that military and economic sanctions were still only\ncontemplated in this hemisphere but that these could be developed.,\nThe Colombian Delegate proposed that exceptions be made for the\nWestern Hemisphere and added that he also believed in such an -ex-\nception for Pan-Arabia. He continued that if in the future there\nwere two or three or four regions he did not believe that would be\na danger to the peace, but thought that that would more assuredly\nresult in security. The Colombian Delegate said of course that one\ncould not foresee developments. For the time being, he would ask\nfor only one exception, since further developments could not be clearly\nanticipated.\n  MR. STAsSEN pointed out that the Colombian had revealed assump-\ntions that he had anticipated were behind the Latin American\' position.\nIt was clear that their position was not based on sound reasoning.\n  MR. STASSEN pointed out that he had heard over and over again\nthat the basic objection to the present plan was -the inability of a re-\ngional organization to act in the event of an arbitrary veto of one of\nthe major powers. He said he had come to the conclusion that it\nmight be best to spell out in the Charter the right of self-defense, in\norder to meet the recurrent criticism on this question. MR. STASSEN\nthen read the following memorandum:\n          "Memorandum to U.S. Delegates and Advisers\n  "On the basis of suggestions and discussions these past few- days\nwith a number of our delegates and advisers it appears to me that\nthe following would be the best answer to our regional problem and\nit would at the same time meet other problems. This language arises\nfrom the suggestions of other delegates and advisers.\n      "VI-E. Self-Defenme\n      "1. Nothing in this Charter shall be construed as abrogat-\n    ing the inherent right of self-defense against a violator -of\n    this Charter.\n      "2. In the application of this provision the principles of\n    the Act of (Chapultepec and of the Monroe Doctrine are spe-\n    cifically recognized.\n  c Summary report of first meeting -of Subcommittee III/4/A, May 10, 5:\n15\np. m., not printed.\n  \'Alberto Lleros Camargo.\n659\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0721&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0721&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0721&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0721&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0721&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0721&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0721&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0720&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0722&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0720&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0722&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0721&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
