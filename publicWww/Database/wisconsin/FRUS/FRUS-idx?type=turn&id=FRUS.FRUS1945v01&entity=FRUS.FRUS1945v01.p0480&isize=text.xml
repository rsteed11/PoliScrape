The Delegates agreed to the position that\nthe Secretary had stated on the questions of Argentina and the Soviet\nRepublics.\n  [The Secretary left the meeting to speak to the Consultants Group\nfor a few minutes and then to see the Soviet Foreign Minister.35]\n  CHAPTER V-THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, SECTION B, PARAGRAPH 1\n  Senator Connally suggested that the group resume, its considera-\ntion of paragraph 1 of Section B in Chapter V. Mr. Pasvolsky said\nthat if the clause in question was taken out, the power of the General\nAssembly to make recommendations on the general principles of co-\noperation and the maintenance of international peace and security,\nincluding the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of\narmaments, would be restored. Senator Connally said that if there\nwas no objection, this clause would be struck out. There being no\nobjection, he stated that the DeIegation hatd agreed.\n             CHAPTER VIII, SECTION B, PARAGRAPH 1\n  Mr. Dulles said that he wanted to raise one question before the\ndiscussion turned away from this paragraph. According to the lan-\nguage now proposed, the General Assembly does not have the power to\nmake specific recommendations for the settlement of a dispute, and\nthe Security Council does not have that power either. It seemed to\nhim that the revised text of the Proposals did not permit any action\non the merits of a dispute, and there was no real conflict on this matter\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky said that under paragraph 1, Section B of Chapter\nVIII the authority to recommend procedures and terms of settlement\nwould lie in the Security Council if it was determined that a threat\nto the peace exists. The Security Council under this paragraph would\nhave unlimited powers to avert a threat to international peace and\nsecurity and could even impose the terms of settlement. Perhaps\nthis provision goes too far, but this is a possible interpretation.\n  Mr. Dulles said that it was a sweeping power, and Mr. Pasvolsky\nreplied that if there was a threat to the peace the Security Council\nhad to have very wide powers of action. Mr. Dulles said that under\nthis power the Security Council could give the Sudetenland to Ger-\nmany or could give Alaska to Russia in order to keep the peace. Mr.\nBloom and Mr. Stassen said simultaneously that it must be remem-\nbered that the five permanent members would have to agree in order\nto impose terms. Mr. Dulles said that because of the veto power the\nUnited States would not be subjected to the imposition of terms of\nsettlement, but that it would be terrific to put the small powers under\n3 See memorandum cf conversation by Mr. Charles E.
