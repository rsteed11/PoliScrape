The memnoran-\n dum printed below was prepared by Harry Dexter White, who ac-\n companied Morgenthau to Quebec. Since this memorandum does not\n indicate that Vhite himself was present, it seems probable that White\n was summarizing what Morgenthlau had told him, or told others in\n his presence, between September 13 and the date on which White\'s\nmemorandum was prepared. Following is the text of the memorandum,\nwhich bears the date "9/25/44" at the end (presumably the date\nof\ntyping):\n  "_Mrs. Roosevelt asked the Secretary to tea. As soon as lhe arrived\nhe -wats ushered in to the President.\' Miss Tully was also present.\n(When he came in, the President turned Ilo Fala his dot, and said\n\'Say hello to your Uncle Henry.\')\n  "The President said that in his conversation with Churchill,2\nChurchill had been very glum. The President said that he had asked\nChurchill: \'How would you like to have the steel business of Europe\nfor 20 or 30 years?\' The President said that Churchill seemed much\nexcited over the possibility.\n  "The President said to the Secretary: \'I have asked you to come up\nhere so that you could talk to the Prof. [Lord Cherwell].\' 3 1Ie said\nthat they were doing shipping that night and therefore were to have\nAdmiral Land but added, \'You might as well come too.\' The Secretary\nasked how freely he could talk with the Professor and the President\nreplied, \'You can talk about anything you want.\' The Secretary in-\nquired: \'Anything?\', and the President said, \'Well, let me look at that\nbook.\' [The book he referred to was the collection of memoranda on\n\'According to the Log, ante, p. 290, Roosevelt conferred with Morgenthau\n"at\nlength" after the latter\'s arrival, following which Roosevelt had tea\nwith Mrs.\nRoosevelt, Miss Tully, and Miss Thompson in the President\'s quarters at 5\np.m.\n2 Presumably during luncheon earlier on September 13.
