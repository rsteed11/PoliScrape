MR. SANDIFER reiterated that\nthis list was by no means comprehensive and it had not been intended\nas a, comprehensive listing of matters which should be considered by\nprocedural vote. MR. SANDIFEIR said he would not favor listing any\ncategories at all unless there were added to the list all the additional\ncategories of questions which should be considered by procedural\nvote. SENATOR VANDENBERG agreed with Mr. Sandifer and added\nthat it was the only safe course. MIR. JOHNSON suggested that the\nDelegation adopt Mr. Sandifer\'s suggestion that Part A be concluded\nafter the word "vote". MR. JOHNSON thought that the Delegation\ncould then add a new section B which would state that questions on\nwhich the Council would act by procedural vote would "include"\nthe four categories then specified in Part A.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY remarked that he seemed to recall Mr. Pasvol-\nsky having had a list of eleven items which should. be considered by\nprocedural vote". MR. DuiAEs thought that a- number of these items\nwere included under point (1) of the present draft, "questions under\nSection D", Chapter VI. SENATOR CONNALLY urged that if it was\nintended to specify some of the categories of questions which would\nbe decided by a procedural vote it would be necessary to specify all\nsuch categories or the unspecified class of questions would auto-\nmatically fall into the bracket of questions which were to be decided\nby a nonprocedural vote.

SENATOR CONNALLY urged that if the\nDelegation was so minded it could adopt this statement of its position\nwithout specifying any categories whatsoever. However, SENATOR\nCONNALLY declared if some categories were specified all others would\nbe excluded. MR.
