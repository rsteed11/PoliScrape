ARMSTRONG commented that Mr. Stassen\'s statement was the\nfirst one he had heard in the course of the discussions suggesting that\nthe British were right. While it might be necessary to accept the\nBritish position on grounds of tactics, he wondered whether the issue\nshould not be met primarily on substantive grounds.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY said our view hadl been that we did not object to\nthe particular power stipulated in the British proposal since the power\nwas limited to recommendation of terms -of settlement alone. What\nwe were afraid of was the possibility that this power might lead to\nthe imposition of terms\'of settlement. He said he thought the British\nproposal was satisfactory as long as it was made clear that it was not\nintended to involve imposition of terms of settlement. MR. BOWMAN\nnoted that in this\'connection we would have the\'veto power.\n  Mn. STASSEN remarked that it was very useful to have the Security\nCouncil empowered to recommend terms of -settlement, and that the\nimposition of terms under this provision was not likely since a vote\nwould require all five permanent members and two additional\'states\nIt was less likely to happen under this provision, he added, than if one\npower was left free to act on its own, since the five powers would have\n-to come to -agreement on the imposition of terms. MR. DurLns noted\nthat we had a veto power on the matter ourselves.\n  MR. ARMSTRONG remarked that we should face the fact that the\nmajor powers did in fact impose \'a settlement upon Czechoslovalkia at\nMunich 18 and that it was just this kind of act\' that would be made\npossible under the British position. MR. STASSEN explained that all\n-the major powers did not agree to Munich--: Russia held out-and the\nsignificant fact was that Munich took place outside any general mecha-\nnism for the maintenance of peace and security.\' He suggested that\nMunich was much less likely to happen if there was an Organization\nthan if there was none. Moreover, he felt that at the present stage of\n-negotiations it was necessary to- make some adjustments in our -point\nof view to accommodate the views of the other governments. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG urged that we negotiate and not retreat. MR. PAsVOtSKY\nreassured him that this was not a retreat but negotiation. It was\ngenerally agreed to support Mr. Pasvolsky\'s proposal on this question.\n  " For text of agreement between Germany, the United Kingdom, France,\nand\nItaly, signed September 29, 1938, see Department of State, Docuinents on\nGer-\nman Foreign\'Policy, 1918-1945, series D., \'i1t It (Washington, Government\nPrint-\ning Office,. 1949), doc.
