General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 465\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nwhere members from some countries had frequently tried to promote\nhighly objectionable ideologies. He concluded that all that can be\ndone is to exchange information and people on a friendly personal\nbasis. He said it was a matter of having a in this country knowing\na in another country. There will be a tremendous demand for ex-\nchange of materials after this war. Countries that have been blocked\noff from normal contacts need everything, .beginning with journals\nand books-. When we are faced with such a demand and it comes in the\nform of a concrete practical job to be done, we can agree on that.\nLooking at the Chinese Proposals again, he said that the Technical\nAdvisers should see what could be done with the text to incorporate the\nintention of Paragraph 3. The professional educators, would not be\nsatisfied, it is true. He was not enough of a politician to know what\nstorms might be created if the word "education" was taken out.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said he was willing to have all sorts of\ninternational interchanges carried on but that it would be impossible\nto write the word "education" into the Charter and then hope for\nfavorable action by the Senate and the House.\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON said he believed it necessary to face realities\nof the world situation on the intellectual and spiritual side.

Three other ideolo-\ngies stemmed from one source, and the forms they take are the Com-\nmunism of Russia, the Naziism of Germany, and the Fascism of Italy.\nMolotov had spoken on behalf of his ideology and with him, being\nagainst Fascism apparently meant being against tyranny.\n  The real question was what would happen in trying to carry on\ncooperation with the three-pronged systems of education where the\nGovernments supported and dominated educational life. We have\nnot educated people for Democracy as these other nations have edu-\ncated their people for their ideologies. We take Democracy rather\nfor granted and feel that we need not worry. The Russian system\nhopes now to advance by pacific means and to gain converts as, in\nfact, it has already done-on a large scale even in this country. He\nwas anxious to get background information on what. we mean by edu-\n-cational cooperation. What would happen if we sent our educational\nphilosophies to the U.S.S.R. and they sent theirs here? Our people\nwould come back converted to thet Communist system. The Russians\nhave succeeded admirably in educating us here with the people they\nhave sent over. How is it possible to cooperate with the educational\nsystem of Russia, which is a country that indoctrinates its people\ndeliberately?\n  MR.
