General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 169\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nstatement was accurate. MR. HIiss replied in the affirmative. The\nSecretary added that the reason that the President had felt that this\nmatter should not be previously disclosed was his desire, if possible,\nto have further discussions with the Soviets that might possibly lead to\na modification of their position. REPRENSTATIVE BLOOM indicated\nthat he had been somewhat embarrassed by not having been kept fully\ninformed on this subject. SENATOR CONNALLY said the matter came\ndown to a question of timing and that the President could not be\njustifiably criticized for having made this announcement. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG indicated that he disagreed with the position taken in\nthe White House statement but that he did not think it was worth while\narguing about it at this time. He noted that in talking with the Presi-\ndent on this matter the President had left the impression that, while\nthe President was himself personally committed to the position, the\nDelegation itself was not bound.\n  THE SECRETARY explained that he hoped the Delegation would make\na recommendation to the President as to how to dispose of this prob-\nlem. Since the President would be away for a short time he thought it\nwould be particularly appropriate for the Delegation to struggle with\nthis question now.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG remarked that he wanted it clearly under-\nstood that he was in accord with the Secretary\'s initial statement that\nnothing should be allowed to interfere with the final result of estab-\nlishing the organization. He was merely trying to point out, he said,\nthat a little more candor would be very helpful.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY said that it was essential for the Delegation\nto act as a unit when it went to San Francisco and that the delegates\nwould have to hang together. SENATOR VANDENBERG noted that each\nindividual still retained his own vote on the Delegation. SENATOR\nCONNALLY replied that what he had in mind was that it would not\nbe wise for members of the Delegation to throw monkey wrenches\ninto the works before the Delegation had had time to formulate its\nown views.\n  THE SECRETARY reassured the members of the Delegation that there\nwas nothing that they did not know, nothing that had been left in\nthe closet, except, as he had said, certain military decisions which he\ncould not discuss.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG stated that, while it was possible to gloss over\nthis whole matter, he believed that the public reaction would be seri-\nous and that the newspapers in particular would inquire why this de-\ncision was not announced in connection with the other Yalta decisions.\nTImE SECRETARY agreed that the public reaction would be adverse.\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON indicated that he seriously questioned the\nbasic nature of the Proposals under contemplation.
