General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1292\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\n                      SECRETARY-GNwERAL\n  SENATOR CONNALLY declared that Committee III/1 had cleaned up\nall the items on the agenda with the exception of procedure for recom-\nmending the Secretary-General for election by the General Assembly.50\nSenator Connally remarked that Ambassador Gromyko had been\nputting pressure on him to speak in favor of the unanimity procedure.\nSenator Connally declared that Professor Webster had spoken for\nthe British and that Ambassador Gromyko had spoken in favor of\nthe unanimity rule and that the French Delegation had spoken in\nfavor as well.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY pointed out that this question had been con-\nsidered originally by Committee II/1 51 and that Representative\nBloom had voted in favor of a strictly procedural vote for the nomi-\nnation of the Secretary-General. However, it had been decided that\nCommittee II/1, dealing with the General Assembly, would not have\nthe authority to decide the voting procedure whereby the Security\nCouncil would nominate the Secretary-General. As a result, the\nmatter was now before Committee III/1 for its decision. REPRE-\nSENTATIVE BLOOM pointed out to the Delegation that he had taken\nhis instructions from the Delegation and hence had voted in favor\nof the procedural vote.52 SENATOR CONNALLY declared that this was\ncorrect and that the Delegation had reversed its position. REPRE-\nSENTATIVE BLooM remarked that he had made his mistake in going\nalong with the Delegation on this question. SECRETARY STnrTINI-rs\nthought that the United States Delegation would have to stand by the\nfive-power position. SENATOR CONNALLY remarked that small powers\nwere disturbed by the outcome of the veto question and were taking\nthis opportunity to attempt to win a victory over the major powers.\nCOMMANDER STASSEN thought that the Delegation would have to\nsupport Senator Connally. Any change of position by the Dele-\ngation would be viewed seriously by the other major powers, espe-\ncially in view of the fact that Russia had been defeated on the matter\nof the deputy Secretaries-General and would undoubtedly be unable\nto reverse the decision. SECRETARY STErnNrus said that Mr. Warren\nand Mr. Hickerson would go into action and THE SECRETARY said that\nhe presumed that the Delegation would not want to change its\nposition.\n  "\' Doe. 975, II1/1/50, June 14, UNCIO Documents, vol. 11, p. 545.\n  1 See report of the Rapporteur of Committee II/1, Doc. 666, II/1/26(1)\n(a),\nMay 30, ibid., vol. 8, p. 452.\n  52 Doe. 328, II/I/13, May 16, ibid., p. 331;
