MR. McCLoy had asked the Latin American delegates\nwhether if we withdrew our proposal, making an exception of treaties\nagainst enemy states, this would solve the difficulty. He reported that\nthey had replied in the negative, suggesting that the whole issue would\nhave arisen anyway in connection with the veto power of the major\nnations. They appreciated the fact that we felt it necessary to keep\nour hand in Europe, realizing that we had spent our men and our re-\nsources in wars that had arisen in Europe over minor incidents. He\nreported that they appreciated our need of finding a formula, and\nthat they were quite sympathetic.\n  MR. MCCLOY suggested that the question might be confronted by\nweighing the relative assets of Europe against the assets of this hemi-\nsphere. He personally believed that both assets were important in\ntheir own way, and he did not feel that we could sit here deciding\nbetween the value of the two assets in a hypothetical way. MR. Mc-\nCLOY felt we would have the sympathy of our Latin American friends\nin reaching a formula. He thought that if such a formula Was\nreached we should consult the President. He proposed that the pro-\ncedure suggested by Ambassador Harriman, to consult only after our\nposition was clear and to hear from the Latin American delegations\nas to their attitude on the problem, would go a long, long way in help-\ning the situation.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG asked Mr. McCloy what he- recommended.\nMR. MCCLOY recommended that we follow along the lines of the proto-\ncol already suggested. He realized, however, that the main difficulty\nlay in the veto power of the major powers.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER expressed the feeling that we would lose the con-\nception of consultation before acting if we accepted the proposal made\nby Mr. Stassen and Mr. Pasvolsky. MR. STASSEN pointed out that it\nwas assumed that we would act in this hemisphere, in the event of\nthe Security Council failing to, act, only after consultation with the\nother states.\n  MR. PAsvoLSKY suggested that the following procedure be adopted:\n  (1) We should not take up changes in paragraph 2, Section 0,\nChapter VIII, as our proposals;\n  (2) We should take up the isstie in the course of consultations with\nother countries and should state our position in the course of these\nconsultations. A number of proposals, including the Cuban pro-\nposal,34 have been brought forward on this question. We should pre-\nsent our case in the course of discussing these proposals.\n  (3) The Secretary should meet with the Latin American repre-\nsentatives as promptly as possible to get their views prior to discuss-\ning the question with Mr. Molotov. He added that we were now\n  3Doe. 2, G/14(g) (3), May 6, UNCIO Documents, vol. 3, p. 524.\n638\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0700&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0700&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0700&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0700&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0700&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0700&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0700&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0699&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0701&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0699&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0701&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0700&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
