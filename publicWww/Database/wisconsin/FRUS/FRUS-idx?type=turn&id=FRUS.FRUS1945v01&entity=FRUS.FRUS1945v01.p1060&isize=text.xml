General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 998\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nremarked that the Chairman would be placed in a very difficult sit-\nuation if he asked for postponement of this question when the United\nStates was already committed to accepting the proposal. MR. DUNN\nwas of the opinion that it would be necessary to go through with the\nmatter and face the other possibilities. The only way this could have\nbeen avoided was by opposing Norway in the first instance. The\nUnited States was now definitely committed to accepting the Nor-\nwegian proposal.\n  MR. ROCKEcFELLER asked how much pressure of time there was on\nthis matter and MR. DuNN replied that it would be considered in the\nnext meeting of the Steering Committee that afternoon. THE SEC-\nRETARY remarked that he had not been consulted on this matter yet\nand hence could not call a meeting. THE SECRETARY was of the opin-\nion that the only course available to the Delegation was to accept\nMr. Dunn\'s recommendation since there was nothing else to do. He\ndeclared that if any oth~er nations were proposed for admission the\nmatter should be referred to the sponsoring governments for their\nconsideration. He thought that one of the small states should make\nthis suggestion. MR. DUNN declared that this course of action would\nopen the way for a "licking". The small states would all ask why\nthe matter should be decided by the major powers without their par-\nticipation. This position had become, he declared, a state of mind\namong the smaller nations. MR. ROCKEFELLER urged that the Dele-\ngation should make up its mind in advance on what other nations\nit would accept. THE SECRETARY declared that he would oppose in-\nviting any other Government. MR. ROCKEFELLER urged that in any\nevent the agreement of the Russians would be necessary and THE SEC-\nRETARY agreed that the Big Five must reach an agreement.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM expressed the opinion that the Delegation\nmust look beyond the immediate situation. If the charge of discrim-\nination were to be raised by any group in this country the result, he\nthought, would be an awful fight in Washington when it comes to\nratifying the Charter. SENATOR CONNALLY suggested that, at the\nmeeting of the Committee of Five, the Secretary should canvass the\nentire situation and "turn the heat on,". An impasse had been reached,\nSENATOR CONNALLY declared, which could be broken only by decisive\naction.... THE SECRETARY asked whether any one on the Delega-\ntion had any objection to the plan to have a meeting of the Committee\nof Five that afternoon. No objection was raised.\n  [Here follows discussion of issues pending.]\n                       VOTING PROCEDURE\n  MR. PASVOLSKY declared that the position of the Delegation on this\nmatter had been clarified in previous meetings and \'needed no further\nexposition at this time.\n998\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1060&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1060&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1060&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1060&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1060&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1060&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1060&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1059&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1061&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1059&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1061&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1060&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
