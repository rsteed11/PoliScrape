You have seen a part of it\nin the negotiations over financial terms of the Protocol 3 in Washilng-\nton. We have other examples here. The general attitude seems to be\nthat it is our obligation to help Russia and accept her policies because\nshe has won the war for us.\n  I am convinced that we can divert this trend but only if we mna-\nterially change our policy toward the Soviet Government. I have\nevidence that they have misinterpreted our generous attitude toward\nthem as a sign of weakness and acceptance of their policies.\n  Time has come when we must make clear what we expect of them\nas the price of our good will. Unless we take issue with the present\npolicy there is every indication the Soviet Union will become a world\nbully wherever their interests are involved. This policy will reach\ninto China and the Pacific as well when they can turn their attention\nin that direction. No written agreement[s] can be of any value unless\nthey are carried out in a spirit of give and take and recognition of the\ninterests of other people.\n  I am disappointed but not discouraged. The job of getting the Soviet\nGovernment to play a decent role in irnternational affairs is however\ngoing to be more difficult than we had hloped. The favorable factors\nare still the samte. Ninety percent of the Russian people want friend-\nship with us and it is much to the interest of the Soviet Government-lt\nto develop it. It is our problem to strengthen the hand of those around\nStalin who want to play the game along our lines and to show Stalin\nthat the advice of the counselors of a tough policy is leading him into\ndifficulties.\n  I realize I cannot in a cable convey to you a fully comiprehensible\npicture of the perplexing developments. However, wklat I say is -fully\nendorsed by General Deane, the air officers heie a tid the Embassy\nofficers.\n  The relation[si of Deane and our otler officers with the Red Air\nForce are good. The Soviet officers have show=;,n embarrassmnent at the\nattitude expressed through the Foreign Office. The influences that I\nspeak of are as unpopular with this group as with ius. When it coniest\nto the question of what we should do in dealing with the sit uation I am\nnot going to propose any drastic action but a firm but, friendly quid p-o\nquo attitude. In some cases where it has been possible for us to show\na firm hand we have been making definite progress.\n  The reference is to the "Soviet sup)ly protocols".
