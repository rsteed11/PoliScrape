General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 411\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nnot be made until the Conference had passed on die question of whether\nthe Soviet Republics were to be seated.\n  The Secretary pointed out that it was possible to propose the slate of\ncandidates for Commission and Committee posts without approval\nof the Soviet Union, and for the Steering Committee to refer the pro-\nposed membership to a special subcommittee. Mr. Rockefeller agreed\nto such a procedure, stating that he was sure the Latin American\nRepublics would support it. Mr. Dunn stated that he was not so\nsure of the support of the European countries, particularly, the smaller\nones who might be wary of a Soviet reaction.\n  It was clear, the Secretary said, that this question wa$ not only\nbringing into the first sessions of the Conference theq ~estion of ad-\nmission of the two Soviet Republics as initial members of th~e Inter-\nnational Organization but was also raising the problem of the status\nof Argentina. Mr. Stassen proposed that Argentina and the two\nSoviet Republics might be seated at the Conference diring the third\nweek, although it could be agreed to earlier that they would become\ninitial members of the International Organization. The Secretary\npointed out that such a proposal was bound to meet opposition from\nPresident Truman, who was dead set against Argentina's being ad-\nmitted to the United Nations.\n  Mr. Dunn therefore suggested that the Secretary General of the\nConference propose the slate of Commission and Committee posts as\nit stood, and if it were not accepted by the Steering Committee, it\nwould then be referred to a special subcommittee of the Steering Com-\nmittee. The Secretary stated that he was concerned as to the countries\nwhich would be appointed as members of such a Subcommittee.\n  During the discussion that followed, it was brought out that the\nSecretary had inquired from the President as to his atitude regarding\na public announcement of the Ugnited States attitude on admitting\nthe two Soviet Republics to the Organization. At this juncture Mr.\nDunn reported that the Soviets had insisted that an item be placed\non the agenda for the first meeting of the Steering Comnmittee covering\nthe question of the admission of the two Republics to the Organization.\n  The Secretary asked the Delegation's opinion as to whether if this\nquestion of the two Republics was reached the next day in the Steering\nCommittee, he should read President Truman's letter to the Commit-\ntee stating the reasons why the United States would support the Soviet\nproposal. Senator Connally felt that the reading of such a letter might\nexpose the strategy being followed by the Delegation and would thus\nweaken its hand. Mr. Stassen also pointed out that reading the letter\nmight carry the implication that the United States Delegation was\nsupporting the Soviet proposal only because it was a commitment\nby former President Roosevelt, and in this event, it would tend to\nfurther weaken the United States position.
