General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 990\n\n\n990           FOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nof Syria and Lebanon. The Department, he said, was issuing a\n"very strong" note which was a "very direct statement"\nof this Gov-\nernment\'s position that France should withdraw its troops from the\nLevantine states. THE SECRETARY expressed the hope that this strong\nmeasure would be successful in bringing to an early close the serious\nsituation existing in the Middle East. He hoped that the British\nand the United States together might be able to impress the French.\nThe situation was so serious, he declared, that some of the Arabs were\ncoming to the point where they were considering rejecting the Charter.\nThe Secretary remarked that he would have to leave the meeting early\nin order to put through a phone call to Washington.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG remarked that the Arabs might also press\nfor recognition of the Arab League as a regional organization under\nChapter VIII, Section C, Paragraph 2, if that paragraph were to be\nleft open any longer.\n                     AMENDMENT PROCEDURE\n  THE CHAIRMAN declared that Mr. Armstrong had an urgent matter\nto take up with the Delegation on the subject of amendment proce-\ndure. MR. ARMSTRONG declared that he had two points he wanted\nto bring to the Delegation\'s attention, one a- specific question and the\nsecond a general situation requiring consideration.\n  MR. ARMSTRONG declared that the subcommittee of Committee I/1\nwas going to vote that day on a British amendment to revise the\nFour-Power amendment to Chapter XI in order that it should be\nspecifically provided that a conference on revision should be held\nnot later than seven years after the coming into effect of the Charter.\nThe British Delegat.e,94 MR. ARMSTRONG remarked, had made his\nproposal without previously consulting the other members of the Big\nFive and had placed the United States in an embarrassing situation.\nActually, MR. ARMSTRONG said, the British suggestion had been that\na conference be held ten years after the entry into force of the Charter,\nbut the Canadians had specifically suggested seven years and had made\na formal motion. As originally presented, the Canadian amendment\nprovided that final ratification of any changes resulting from a revi-\nsionary conference would be subject to the unanimity requirement.\nThis procedure, however, did not suit Mr. Evatt of Australia who\ndid not want any control over amendment procedure by the Security\nCouncil. Mr. Evatt had succeeded in postponing the decision over-\n\' William Mabane, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food; assistant\ndelegate, British delegation. At the second meeting of Subcommittee I/2/E,\nMay 30, 8: 30 p. m., Mr. Mabane submitted a proposal that "such a conference\nshall be held not later than ..... years after the entry into force of the\nCharter." Lester B. Pearson, Senior Adviser of the Canadian delegation,\nmoved\nthe adoption of Mr. Mabane\'s motion with the proviso that the period be not\nmore than seven years after the entry into force of the Charter. The vote\nwas\npostponed in order to permit consultation.
