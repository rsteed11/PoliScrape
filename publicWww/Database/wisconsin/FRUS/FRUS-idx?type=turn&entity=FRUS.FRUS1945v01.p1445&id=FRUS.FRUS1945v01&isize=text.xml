SmTINIrus of the United States presided. He stated that since\nthis afternoon\'s meeting, several of the group had discussed the\nlanguage of the Russian text with certain other people. While the\nsuggestion of the Soviet Union went a long way toward meeting the\nsituation, he regretted that this consultation with the smaller powers\nrevealed that they felt it impossible to accept the Soviet suggestion\nwithout one minor change. He then read the following text:\n  "The General Assembly has the right to discuss any questions or\nany matters within the sphere of the Charter or relating to the powers\nand functions of any organs provided in the Charter, and except as\nprovided in Paragraph 2b of this Section, to make recommendations\nto the members of the United Nations or to the Security Council or\nboth on any such questions or matters."\n  MR. S   rwIN\'us asked if the Soviet Union would find any difficulty\nin accepting the phrase "sphere of the Charter". If so, he suggested\nalternatively the phrase "scope of the Charter" or "sphere\nof action\nof the Organization". He noted that this latter phrase had been\nused by the League of Nations. MR. STEmnNItrs repeated that we\nwere almost together on this, and it really was a matter of words. He\nhoped that AMBASSADOR GROMxYO could communicate promptly\nwith his government and find out if one of these three phrases would\nbe acceptable.\n  LORD HALIFAX observed that in the talks between MR. STEMNIUS\nand Dr. Evatt, in which he had been invited to assist, Dr. Evatt took\nthe point that the original draft that he had been prepared to put\nforward 51 had been modified, but that only one out of three or four\npoints were of importance to him. LORD HALIFAX said that they had\nbeen able to bring Dr. Evatt to this wording, which seemed a reason-\nable division between a position of the Soviet Government and Dr.\nEvatt\'s position. He added that Dr. Evatt did not like this draft\nbut that he could be pressed into taking it. MR. STrrNnrs agreed\nthat Dr. Evatt was not happy about the text but would take it. He\nbelieved that we could not get a successful vote without this additional\nwording.\n  M. DE]EAN stated that he would accept the Ambassador\'s text, but\nthat he would consider the necessity of obtaining a successful vote in\nthe Committee. MR. SmTrrINIus said that we are all of the same vote\non that, and that we would accept the Russian draft if it could be\naccepted by the Conference, but he was convinced that that was im-\npossible. DR. Koo thought that the revised text was almost the same\nas the Russian text and he really hoped that it would be accepted by\n  51 For the Australian proposal of May 5, see Doe. 2, G/14(1), UNCIO Docu-\nments, vol. 3, p. 544; for the revised text of June 17, see Doe. 1060, EX/26,\nJune 18,\nibid., vol. 5, p. 533.\n     723-681-47- 91\n1383\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1445&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1445&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1445&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1445&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1445&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1445&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1445&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1444&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1446&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1444&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1446&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1445&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
