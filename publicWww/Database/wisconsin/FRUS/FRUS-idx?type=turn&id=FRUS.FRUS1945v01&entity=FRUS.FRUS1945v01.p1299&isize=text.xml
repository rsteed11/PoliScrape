HIICKERSON replied that a paper had not been prepared on the\nquestion. Tio SECRETARY declared that he wanted some one to pre-\nsent to the Delegation a factual analysis of the Italian request. The\nDelegation was referred to the text of the statement of the Italian\nCouncil of Minisfers addressed to the San Francisco Conference, as\nfollows:\n  "The Italian Council of Ministers deems it its duty to express the\nsense of deep disappointment of the Italian people at the exclusion\nof democratic Italy from a Conference destined to lay the foundation\nof a peaceful life among nations.\n  "The Council of Ministers recalls with deep emotion the words pro-\nnounced in June 1944 by the great President Roosevelt: \'We want\nItaly\'s help and we count on Italy\'s help for the building of a lasting\npeace.\' 90\n  "This help Italy has given for eighteen months and is still giving\nto the extent allowed her and with all the means at her disposal. This\nhelp she is ready to give also in the future, whenever the cause of\ndemocracy has still to win its battles. Her fleet, her air forces and\nher regular ad partisan units have contributed to victory, and her\npeople are organizing themselves under the rule of liberty and de-\nmocracy, despite the tremendous destructions and the hard armistice\nterms still in force and binding. This help Italy is ready to give also\nin peace time, for the work of reconstruction to which President\nRoosevelt called her.\n  "On behalf of that help given and offered, on behalf of her mil-\nlenary civilization, on behalf of the moral principles that the United\nNations have written on their flags, democratic Italy, standing before\nall the United Nations, great and small, with many of which she has\nvery close cultural and blood ties asks for the right and reaffirms her\nwill to take part in the work for world reconstruction, whose founda-\ntions are now being laid in San Francisco".\n  R;EPRESENTATIVES BLoom asked whether the Italian request might not\nbe the result of propaganda originating within this country favoring\nthe admission of Italy to the Organization.
