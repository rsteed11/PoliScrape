Senator Connally said it was worth thinking about mak-\ning some clear provision for removing officials who violated this pro-\nvision of the Charter. Mr. Bowman observed that the League of\nNations had had a scheme for retirement and that it would be possible\nto work out the necessary regulations. Mr. Dulles said that normally\nthe officials of the Organization would be removable for violations.\nSenator Connally remarked that he thought a penalty was needed in\naddition to the general policy.\n  Mr. Gerig called attention to the fact that in the draft constitution\nfor the Food and Agriculture Organization there was a provision\nsimilar to the suggested new paragraph 6.  Mr. Dulles said it might\nbe suggested that the Assembly would have a general power to remove\nany official who violated this provision. Mr. Stassen said it would\nbe important not to interfere with the authority of the Secretary-\nGeneral as the chief administrative officer of the Organization.\n   Mr. Armstrong suggested that there should be some discussion of\nthe responsibility of the member states to grant immunities and priv-\nileges to the officials of the Organization, and members of its organs\nand other bodies, especially since it was contemplated in some quarters\nthat the Organization might meet from time to time in different coun-\ntries. Mr. Gerig said there was a section on that point in the pro-\nposed new chapter on juridical status. Mr. Armstrong read the\nproposed new chapter on juridical status, paragraph 3.\n   [3. The members of the Organization should accord diplomatic\n privileges and immunities to persons appointed by other members as\n their representatives in or to the Organization, and to the higher offi-\n cials of the Organization, not being their own nationals. Immunity\n from jurisdiction shall be subject to waiver by the members of the\n Organization in the case of their representatives in or to the Orga-\n nization, and by the Organization in the case of higher officials of the\n Organization.]\n   Mr. Sandifer said that this chapter together with the ones proposed\n on the registration of treaties and on inconsistent obligations had been\n left for Mr. Hackworth\'s committee" to consider. Mr. Armstrong\n said he just wanted to open up the question whether it would be suit-\n able to have such a provision in the chapter on the Secretariat if there\n were no separate chapter on Juridical Status. Mr. Stassen said that\n in Chapter X only the members of the Secretariat were involved, but\n that in the proposed separate chapter all officials and representatives\n of the Organization could be included.\n    Senator Vandenberg asked how it would be possible to exempt offi-\n  cers of the Organization from taxation of their salaries.
