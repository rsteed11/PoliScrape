General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 981\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nman aggression, were to be affected in such a way that they might\nat some time in the future be cancelled. Mr. Dejean declared that\nhe understood that the provision as it existed would protect the\nFrench treaty relationships but he declared that the French people\nwanted this matter made crystal clear. Mr. Dejean had indicated\nthat he could accept the language of the draft of May 23, and he\ndeclared that this language would have the additional advantage of\nstrengthening the role of the international organization by making\nit clear that the Organization would definitely be charged with the\nresponsibility for "preventing further aggression by a state enemy\nof the United Nations in this war." Mr. Dejean had voiced the\nopinion that the new wording would not involve a change in meaning\nbut that it would change the political and psychological effect. MR.\nDUNN said that it was certain that the French would not receive any\nchange in instructions and he declared that Mr. Dejean had indicated\nhis regret at having had to take the lead in the Committee discussion,\ninasmuch as he was not the chief delegate.\n  SECRETARY STETTINIUS asked Mr. Dunn what course of action he\nwould recommend to the Delegation. MR. DUNN replied that he\nfavored accepting the language of May 23. He declared that he had\nfavored accepting the change of only the one word, "consent", for\nwhich the French had substituted "request" in their draft, because\nthis procedure would rule out the possibility of reopening the whole\nparagraph. However, MR. DUNN declared that he had been satisfied\nby the discussion of the previous day that the paragraph would not\nbe reopened if the French suggestion were to be accepted. THE SEC-\nRETARY declared that he would make a deal with Mr. Dunn and would\nsupport the French proposal if the French would agree to drop their\namendment on the question of raw materials. COMMANDER STASSEN\nremarked, however, that the French were not the only government\npressing on the latter question. He indicated that he was opposed\nto accepting the French language because he was afraid it would open\nup the entire regional question. Furthermore, COMMANDER STASSEN\nthought that the French argument, to which Mr. Dunn had referred,\nthat Communist elements in France would make trouble for the gov-\nernment unless the change were accepted was not a valid argument\ninasmuch as the original Four-Power amendment had been proposed\nby the Russians.82\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG asked Mr. Dulles for his opinion on this\nquestion. The latter replied that he was not opposed to the French\n  82   of proposed Four-Power amendment of chapter VIII, C, 2, UNCIO Docu-\nments, vol. 3, p. 688 (Doe. 288, G/38, May 14); for Soviet proposal, see\nibid.,\np. 601 (Doc. 2, G/14 (w) (1), May 8); United States proposal, ibid., p. 598\n(Doc.\n2, G/14(v), May 6). For Soviet acceptance of text proposed by the United\nStates, see minutes of the Five-Power meeting, May 7, 3 p. m., p. 628.\n981\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1043&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1043&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1043&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1043&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1043&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1043&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1043&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1042&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1044&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1042&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1044&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1043&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
