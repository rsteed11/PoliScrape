It was not so long ago that we were crying out for air-\nplanes-now we had a surplus. He suggested that if the British were\nheavily engaged in Southeast Asia and in Malaya they would require\na large proportion of their air forces for these operations. Was there\na distinction between these latter operations and the operations en-\nvisaged by Sir Charles Portal for heavy bombardment of Japan?\n  SIR CHARLES PORTAL replied that there was a distinction. The Lanl-\ncaster bomber, if refuelled in the air, had a range nearly approaching\nthat of the B-29. Without refuelling in the air these aircraft had a\nrange of 800 or 900 miles.8\n  Ti-HE PRESIDENT observed that there were certain groups in the\nUnited States, and he had no doubt that similar groups existed in\nGreat Britain, w ho evinced a kindly attitude towards the Germ-ans.\nTheir theory was that evil could be eradicated from the Gcrnian\nmake-up and the nation could be rejuvenated by kindness.\n  THE PRIME AMINISTER said that such sentiments would hardly be\ntolerated in Great Britain. The British people would demand a strong\npolicy against the Germans. The German working man should be\nallowed sufficient food for his bare need, and work, but no more. The\nmore virulent elements such as the Gestapo and the young fanatics\nshould be deported to work in rehabilitating the devastated areas of\nEurope. Plans for the partition of Germany were now in the course\nof preparation but no final decisions had been taken.\n  In conclusion, TIJE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clear that a\nvery great measure of agreement existed between the American and\nBritish Staffs.\n  ADMIRAL LEAHY agreed that this was so. He did not foresee any\ninsuperable difficulties in reaching agreement on all points at issue.\n8 The British minutes referred to in fn. 4, above, have the following additional\nstatement by Churchill at this point:\n  "The Prime Minister remarked that for the future good relations of\nthe two\ncountries, on which so much depended, it was of vital importance that the\nBritish should be given their fair share in the main operations against Japan.\nThe United States had given the most handsome assistance to the British Empire,\nin the fight against Germany. It could only be expected that the British\nEmpire ill return should give the United States all assistance in their power\ntowards the defeat of Japan."
