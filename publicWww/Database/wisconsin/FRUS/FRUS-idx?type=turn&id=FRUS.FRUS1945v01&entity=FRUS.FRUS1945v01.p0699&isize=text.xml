SENA-\nTOR VANDENBERG asked Mr. Pasvolsky whether he would be willing\nto have him tell the Senate that if the Security Council voted no and\nwe thought action was vitally necessary we could take action on our\nown. MR. PASVOLSKY remarked that he would have no objection to\nSenator Vandenberg making the statement that if the Security Coun-\ncil failed we would have to go ahead and act.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLooM asked whether; the Monroe Doctrine still\nremained untouched. MR. PASVOLSKY replied in the affirmative. SEN-\nATOR CONNALLY asked how the Monroe Doctrine was protected. MR.\nPASVOLSKY stated that the Monroe Doctrine is protected by our right\nof veto and by the obligation assumed by all the states, including the\nbig powers, not to intervene. The old [whole?] system, he said, rests\nupon the good faith of the big powers and their willingness to behave.\nIf they fall out there is no opportunity to keep the peace.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG indicated that our only protection was then\nour right of independent action. MR. PASVOLSKY stated that this\nwas not our only protection, but that there was certainly no statement\nin the text under which we would give up our right of independent\naction. MR. DOuEs indicated his general agreement with Mr. Pas-\nvolsky, but pointed out that he would argue the case on different\ngrqunds. He thought that Senator Vandenberg could say that at\nno point would the member states give up their right to use force in all\ncircumstances. Under principle four they pledged to refrain from\nthe use of force. in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the or-\nganization. Since the prevention of aggression was a purpose of the\norganization, action to prevent aggression in the absence of action by\nthe Security Council would be consistent with the purposes of the\norganization. ,He thought that if a European country vetoed action\nto prevent aggression in the Western Hemisphere, we would be en-\ntirely free to use force. MiR. STAssix stated that in order to keep us\nfree to use force under these circumstances, he had previously favored\nthe omission of the phrase in principle four "consistent with the pro-\nvisions of the Charter". SENATOR VANDENBERG commented that he\nhad no further complaint to make, but that he was now convinced that\nthe people would be disillusioned beyond words when they realized\nthe plan. MR. STASSEN said he would be willing to speak on the sub-\nject and would gladly testify before the Senate Foreign Affairs Com-\nmittee. SENATOR VANDENBERG thought that there was a general re-\nnunciation of the right to use force. Both MR. DtTLLES and Mit. STAS-\nSEN pointed out that this was not the case.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY suggested that Mr. McCloy make a statement.\nMR. MOCLOY pointed out that he had just had a talk with certain\nLatin American delegates who had, in a tolerant and composed way,\nshown that they knew our problem and appreciated our situation.
