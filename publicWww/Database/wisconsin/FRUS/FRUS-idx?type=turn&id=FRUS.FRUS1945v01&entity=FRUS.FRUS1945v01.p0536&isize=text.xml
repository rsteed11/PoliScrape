STINEBOWER stated that this paragraph had been considered\nby the Delegation at its first meeting when the economic questions\ncame up.69 The first part of the paragraph, he observed, was not new.\nThe new part is the part underlined. The first part of the paragraph\nwas originally the last sentence of paragraph 1.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY stated that this again was something which should\nbe put up by other governments, and in that event it might be sup-\nported by the United States.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY inquired whether this was to involve any\nauthority beyond that of recommendation, and MR. PASVOLSKY re-\nplied that this was all that was involved. SENATOR CONNALLY stated\nthat he would then have no objection.\n  [The Secretary of State and Commander Stassen arrived at this\npoint.]\n  MR. STINEBOWER explained that the next suggested change was some-\nthing new-a new statement in Section B, providing for a staggered\nsystem of representation on the Economic and Social Council.\n  MR. DuNN inquired whether this had been proposed by any other\nDelegation, and MR. STINEBOWER said that it had not. It was not to\nbe considered a substantive proposal, however.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG suggested that it appeared unobjectionable\nand might be marked "B".70\n  MR. STINEBOWER further explained that the suggested changes in\nSections C and D were not new and had been approved by the Delega-\ntion in Washington.\n  It was agreed that all of these changes, while acceptable, would be\nmarked "B" and although they would not be put forward by this Gov-\nernment, they would be carefully watched by the American repre-\nsentatives on Commission II.71\n  An executive session was called at this point (9: 05 p. m.) and the\nEconomic Advisers left.\n8 Brackets throughout remainder of this document appear in the original.\n69 See minutes of meetings of the United States delegation, April 11 and\n18,\npp. 259 and 330, respectively.\n70The classification "B" refers to changes in the Dumbarton Oaks\nProposals\nwhich the United States delegation was prepared to support.\n"1April 28 draft of chapter IX, in "Proposals Which the U.S. is\nPrepared to\nSupport (B) ", not printed.\n474\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
