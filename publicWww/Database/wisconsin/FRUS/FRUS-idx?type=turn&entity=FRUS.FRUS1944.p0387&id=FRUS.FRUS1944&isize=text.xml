Admiral Leahy\nthought the only way to assure peace in the future was for the United\nStates, the United Kingdom and possibly Russia \'if she behaves her-\nself\' to \'crack down\' on any country which stepped over the boundary\nline of any other country.\n  "The President said very little in reply to Churchill\'s views. Secre-\ntary Morgenthau several times interjected into Churchill\'s commentis\nthat his program did not recommend that Germany be permitted to\nstarve as seemed to be the implication in Churchill\'s remark.\n  "At another point when discussing the need for an international\npolice air force Churchill said that the United States, United Kin gdom\nand Russia would have to rotate the job \'as our air people get dirty\nwlhen they associate with the Russi ans.\'\n  "At one point in the discussion Churchill said to the President: \'Is\nthis what y ou asked me to come all the way over here to discuss?\'\n  "The conversation then got on to India arid staved on liIdia for\nabout an hour. Churchill talked rather angrily at length about the\ndifficulties the British were confronted with in- administering India\nand on the lack of understanding in the United States about the Indian\nproblem. He spoke of the high birth rate, the high death rate, the\nignorance and the carelessness of the Indian people to poverty, disease,\netc. Churchill said, \'I will give the United States half of lndia to\nadmninister and we will take the other half and we will see who does\nbetter with each other\'s half.\'\n  "However, the President caine back to the German problem several\ntimes very nicely and did not recede from his position. He reminded\nChurchill that Stalin at Teheran had said: \'Are you g oi-ng to let Ger-\nmany produce, modern metal furniture? The manlluacture of metal\nfurniture can be quickly turned into the manufacture off ar )nanonh\' 6\n  "Lord Cherwell seemed to be in sympathy with the Secretari es\npoint of view. Later when talking it over with him hee said that "he\ndidn\'t think that Churchill at all got the major point the Secretary\nwas trying to make. The Secretary asked him if he didncli think the\nreal difficulty with Churchill was that he wanted a strong G-erlmany\nto stand between \'the white, cliffs of Dover\' and Coinmmunisis Russia.\nCherwell agreed that that was it. Lord Leathers of the Shippilln 13Boatrd\napparently disagreed with the Secretary\'s point of view.\n  "On leaving, Lord Cherwell said that he expected to talk fwith the\nSecretary about lend-lease assistance for the period bet-ween the defeat\nof Germany and the defeat of Japan. The Secre\'Clary told himt thlat he\nhad been asked by the President to come to tIalk about Germany but\nafter [that2] he would be glad to discuss lend-lease ai(i the followilng\nmorning after they had had their convevPst)voa abouut Gerniamt-v.\n  "The Secretary had an opportunity to tell the President; that he\nbelieved the Russians were holding back on their cooperavtion with tile\nUnited States because they were suspicious of the American and\nBritish attitude toward Germany. Russia feared we and tile British\nwere going to try to make a soft peace with Germany and build her\n\' See Foreign Relations, The Conferences at Cairo and Tehran, 1943, pp. 511,\n880.\n327\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0388&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0386&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0388&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0387&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
