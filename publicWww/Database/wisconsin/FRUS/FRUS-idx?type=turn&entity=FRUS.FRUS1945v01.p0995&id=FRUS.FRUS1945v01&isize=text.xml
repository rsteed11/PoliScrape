JEBB commented that some fool had already put the question\nand that the joker question was number- 19 (Memorandum on Ques-\ntionnaire on Exercise of Veto in Security Council, UNCIO, May 22,\n1945 42). That question was: "In case , decision has to, be taken as\nto whether a certain point is a procedural matter, is that preliminary\nquestion to be considered in itself as a procedural matter or is the veto\napplicable to such preliminary -questio-n i.." Mr. Jebb said that he\nhad\nreplied that the veto was not applicable, whereas the Soviet Govern-\nment had said the veto was applicable.-\n  Mn. STEnTINius asked whether Ambassador Halifax would like to\ndiscuss this matter further with his Delegation. AMBASSADOR HALI-\nFAX replieithat he would like a further opportunity to consider it and\nparticularly the statement made by Mr. Dulles. He thought- it might\nbe possible to redraft paragraph -3. MR. STETTINIUS felt that a de-\ncision must be reached by Monday and suggested that the group meet.\nagain the following afternoon. AMBASSATOR GROMYEO suggested\nthat he might not have anything to say on this question before Tues-\nday. AMBASSADOR HALIFAX suggested that the Subcommittee meet\nthe following day and that this group provisionally agree to meet at\n9: 30 in the evening.\n  AMBASSADOR GROMYKO indicated that the question was how properly\nbefore the heads of the delegations. There had been no disagreement\nin the Subcommittee, but now it was up to this group to discuss the\nquestion thoroughly.\n  AMBASSADOR HALIFAX stated that this group had had particular\ndifficulty with paragraph 3 and that it might be well to see whether\nthis paragraph could not be clarified by some redrafting. We could\nthen discuss the work of the Subcommittee on this paragraph.- DR.\nSOONG suggested a MAonday morning meeting for this group with prior\ndiscussion in the Subcommittee. MR. STETTINIUS said he would like to\nappeal to the members of the group to reach a decision on this question.\nSENAOR CONNALLY agreed that it was of the highest importance to\nreach a. decision or otherwise we could expect an uprising and a re-\nbellion of the smaller states.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG urged that a meeting be held promptly to\nsettle the question of the French amendment to paragraph 2, Section\nC, Chapter VIII. Mn. STETTINIuS agreed that this question should\nbe brought up and that another meeting should be held promptly.\n  AMBASSADOR HALIFAx suggested that Mr. Dulles had presented a\nmost coherent argument, and that, if the Subcommittee could meet\nand clarify paragraph 3, it might be possible to reach agreement in\n   Doe. 855, III/1/B/2 (o), June 8, UNCIO Documents, vol. 11, p. 707.\n933\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0995&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0995&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0995&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0995&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0995&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0995&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0995&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0994&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0996&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0994&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0996&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0995&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
