In the\ncourse of these discussions it had been pointed out that the League\nof Nations had never really answered this question. MR. PASVOLSKY\nsuggested that it would be possible for the Subcommittee to meet at\neleven o'clock the next day. MR. STETTiNIuS suggested that the heads\nof the delegations could then meet in the evening.\n  MR. STETTINIUs asked whether any statement could be made to thi\npress on this matter. AMBASSADOR GROMY1'O replied that he wished\nto study the question of paragraph 3 but that he had already said\nlhe was ready to talk on question 19. AMBASSADOR HALIFAX thought\nthere would be a bad effect if the discussions were in any way made\npublic property. MR. STEmNIUS felt, however, that the delay was\ncausing considerable confusion and that some statement would have\nto be made soon. MR. DUNN commented that it was more important\nto have agreement on this question and that we would have to take\nthe timrne that was necessary to get agreemnent. He did not think we\nshould set any particular time for a statement, but should see what\nthe Subcommittee could accomplish and then decide the next step.\nMR. STETNIUS agreed that no time would be set, but he did feel\nthat something should be said to the press over the weekend to avoid\nharmful speculation. Mn. SOBOLEV thought it was best' to say nothing.\nMR. STETTINIUS thought it was better to say something in order to\navoid confusion. AMBASSADOR GROMYKO said that a statement could\nbe made that we were discussing these questions, but he did not feel\nthat anything should be said on the substance of the questions. MR.\nSTENINIUS said it was essential that he be authorized to say some-\nthing after this meeting.\n  AMBASSADOR HALIFAX suggested that the Chairman should say that\nwe had met and had a full discussion and that there was a large\nmeasure of agreement. Other points were still under discussion, and\nthis discussion would be continued. THE AMBASSADOR said that, if\nthis brief statement satisfied the-press, the press was very easily\nsatisfied.\n  MR. STME'INIUS suggested that at the next meeting the members\nshould be prepared to discuss the French treaty amendment.\n  The meeting was adjourned by the Chairman at 10: 30 p. m.\nRSC Lot 60-D 224, Box 96: US Cr Min 56\nMinutes of the Fifty-Sixth Meeting of the Unitod States Delegation,\n       Held at San Francisco, Monday, May 2q 1945, 9 a. m.\n                         [Informal Notes]\n  [Here-'follows list of 'names of persons.
