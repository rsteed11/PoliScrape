Since receiving Department\'s 1518, February 28 and giving\nyour message to Mr. Eden (my 2096, February 28 95) the following\nletter which Mr. Eden had written earlier in the evening was delivered\nto the Embassy.\n  It is a reply to Secretary Stettinius\' message contained in Depart-\nment\'s 1481 of February 27:\n  "My dear Ambassador, Many thanks for your letter of today\'s\ndate which I have just received, enclosing a message from Mr. Stet-\ntinius. As you know, the French asked for 24 hours\' delay before\ngiving their answer, but this was received in the Foreign Office after\nlunch today and we at once sent the telegram to Moscow which was\nagreed between your staff and mine.\n  I think it would be inadvisable for Mr. Stettinius, whatever his\ndifficulties in Mexico City, to issue the invitations and to publish the\nvoting procedure before the Russians have agreed to the amendments\nto the invitation now suggested by the French and have also said\nthat they agree that the French should make a unilateral statement.\n  So far as I am concerned, I regret this delay but I do not see, in\nview of the French attitude, how it could have been avoided. In any\ncase I would repeat that it is even more important to preserve har-\nmony between the five sponsoring powers and to obtain general agree-\nment that the French should be a sponsoring power also than it is\nto explain the position to Latin America.\n  If, however, as we hope, we get a telegram early tomorrow morn-\ning from Clark Kerr saying that the Russians agree, there should be\nample time for Mr. Stettinius to issue and publish the invitation, and\nto have a profitable discussion with the representatives of Latin\nAmerica in Mexico City, before the end of the conference in that town.\n  I should be greatly obliged if you could pass on my views to Mr.\nStettinius as soon as possible and add that he has all my sympathy in\nthe difficulties with which he is now contending.\n  Yours sincerely,                               Anthony Eden."\n                                                          WINANT\n 93In telegram 954, February 28, 10 p. m., from Paris, Ambassador Caffery\nre-\n ported: "I spoke to Bidault at 7: 30 Paris time on the subject of not\npublishing\n his communiqui yet. He said he would see what could be done but I apprehend\n that he had jumped the gun. I have informed the Russians here of what we\n have been doing."
