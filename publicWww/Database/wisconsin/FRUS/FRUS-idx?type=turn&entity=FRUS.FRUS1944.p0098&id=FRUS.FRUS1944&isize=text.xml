I reported that I had told himi we\nwould have no objection to his flying up and spending the evening\nthere if he could come back the next day. There was considerable dis-\ncussioii as to whether we should suggest that the President ask Church-\nill not to call him up, but this was entirely inconclusive. The point of\nview was also expressed that this changed the entire character of the\nQuebec conference from one of a military nature to one of a political\nnature and it was very serious to be having a political conference with-\nout Stalin present. Incidentally I informed the group that the Presi-\ndent had assured me that if the British called any political men to\nQuebec he would do likewise. (This was not done, Morgenthau being\nthe only person called up although through special arrangements we\ndid have Ambassador Atherton at Quebec, although he did not partic-\nipate in any direct way at the meeting.)\nTalks During the Day With the Secretary\n  Early in the day I had a, discussion with the Secretary on the voting\nprocedure and also on the question of Cadogan's being ordered to\nQuebec. I also told him of the possibility that Eden was coming to\nQuebec. Mr. I-lull made the same point which was made at the Amer-\nican meetinga by Mr. Long, that clhanging the character of the meeting\nin a politi.ci directio-a, and probably discussing the future of Europe\nwithout Stalin being present was quite a serious matter.\n  Tle Secretary thinks that it would be most unfortunate if Cadogan\ngoes to Quebec, not only from the point of view of our Conversations at\n1 In the form of a daily record pertaining to Stettinius' activities in Wash-\nington during the Dumbarton Oaks conversations.
