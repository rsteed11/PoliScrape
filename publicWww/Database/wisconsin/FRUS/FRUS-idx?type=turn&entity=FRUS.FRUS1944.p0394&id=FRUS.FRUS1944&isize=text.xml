He could not say exactly where the fleet could be employed\nat this moment but there would be ample opportunity for its use\nprovided it was self-supporting.\n  ADMIRAL KING said that the question of the British proposal for the\nuse [of] the main fleet would have to be referred to the President\nbefore it could be accepted.\n  ADMIRAL LEAHY said that if Admiral King saw any objections to\nthis proposal he should take the matter up himself with the President.9\nIt mighlt not be wise to use the term "main fleet."\n  SIRS ANDmEw CUNNINGHAM said that the British Fleet had been\noffered by the Prime Minister and the President had accepted it. He\nwas prepared to ,agree to the deletion of the word "main" from\npara-\ngraph 1 of C.C.S. 452/27.\n  ADMIRAL KING said that the Prime Minister had also referred to\nthe use of British air power in the Pacific.\n  GENERAL ARNOLD said that a definite answer with regard to British\nair help in the war against Japan could not be given now. The amount\nwhich could be absorbed would depend on the development of suitable\nfacilities.\n  SIR CITARLES PORTAL said that it was, of course, impossible to be\ndefinite at the moment since the forces available wvould depend on the\nlength of the war with Germany. What he would ask for was air\nfacilities available in the bases in the Pacific so that the British could\nplay their part. Hle would put forward a proposal for consideration.\n  GENERAL MARSHALL said that the best method would be a statement\nof numbers of aircraft and dates at which they would be available.\n  GEJNERAL ARNOLD agreed that this would be preferable.\n  Referring to paragraph 2 of C.C.S. 452/27, SIR ALAN BRoxKE\npointed out that this paragraph dealt with the formation of a British\nEmpire task force which was the second alternative put forward by\nthe British Chiefs of Staff if for any reason the support of the British\nFleet in the main operations could not be accepted. Since this support\nhad been accepted there would be no British naval forces available\nfor the task force and British land forces could only arrive at a later\ndate. He suggested therefore that this paragraph should be deleted.\n  ADMIRAL ICING asked if it was intended to use the British Fleet only\nin the main operations and to make no contribution to a task force in\nthe Southwest Pacific.\n  GENERAL MARSHALL said there were certain objections to forming a\nBritish Empire task force under General MacArthur\'s command at\nthe present time. This had been proposed by General Blamey but if it\n9 No indication has been found that King did in fact take this matter up\nwith\nRoosevelt. Cf.
