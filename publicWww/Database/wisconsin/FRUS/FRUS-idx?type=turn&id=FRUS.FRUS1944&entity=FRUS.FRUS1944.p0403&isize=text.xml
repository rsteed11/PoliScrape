(Morgenthau Diary, vol.\n772) White, in recording a meeting between Morgenthau and Cherwell\non the morning of September 15 (see post, p. 359), quoted Morgenthau\nas saying, with reference to the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting on Sep-\ntember 14, that Churchill "seemed to accept the program designed\nto weaken German economy.... Churchill had already spoken of\ndiverting Germany to an agricultural state as she was in the last\nquarter of the 19th Century." (Treasury Files)\n  See Churchill, Triumph and Tragedy, pp. 156-157, for a summary\nof a "number of conversations" which Churchill had with Roosevelt\nand his advisers on the German question.\nCherwell Papers\n    Memoranduim by the British Paymaster-General (Cherwell) 1\n                                    QUEBEC, 14th Sept[ember] 1944.\n  Mr Morgenthau said he had been discussing with Lord Cherwell his\nproposals on the economic disarmament of Germany 2 and would like\nhim to give his impressions of these.\n  Lord Cherwell said he had, of course, not had time to read the papers\nor study the proposals in detail but he was definitely attracted by the\npossibilities set forth. So far as he understood it the intention was to\nhamstring Germany\'s capacity for making war by taking whatever\nmachinery was usable from the Ruhr and other areas in which industry\ncapable of making war-like weapons was concentrated, and handing it\nover to the numerous countries she had devastated. The Ruhr and\nperhaps the other areas in question would be then placed under an\ninternational authority which should decide whether and when and to\nwhat degree industries of this type should be allowed to be re-built\nthere. If the Germans were deprived of the possibility of making steel\non a large scale as well as certain types of chemicals and electrical\nmachinery, she would not be in a position to produce the armaments\nrequired for modern war. She would, of course, not starve. Her exports\nwould be reduced and she might therefore go short of certain materials.\nBut her standard of life would still undoubtedly be higher than it\nhad been under the Nazis-when so much national effort was put into\n  \'When Cherwell discussed this memorandum with Morgenthau on the morning\nof September 15, 1944 (see post, p. 359), the latter felt that -it "went\ntoo far in\nthe wrong direction". According to Morgenthau\'s diary entry for September\n15,\nMorgenthau felt that Cherwell\'s minutes "presented much too weak a case"\nand\nthat Churchill could be prevailed upon "to go much further". Morgenthau\nand\nCherwell, by agreement, therefore, reported that they did not have minutes\non\nthe German discussion of September 14 when Churchill asked for them on\nSeptember 15.
