General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 305\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\ntions there would not be much value. There was general agreement\nwith this position.\n  At this point SENATOR CONNALLY directed attention to the "draft\nstatement 97 in support of the retention of Chapter VIII, Section C,\non regional arrangements of The Dumbarton Oaks Proposals"\', which\nhad been approved by the Committee on Security Aspects of Prepara-\ntion for the United Nations Conference, and asked the military and\nnaval advisers of the Delegation if they had any comments to make.\nADMIRAL HEPBURN indicated that he had seen the paper and although\nhe had not had an opportunity to read it carefully, endorsed it. GEN-\nERAL EMBICK was fearful lest the Declaration of Chapultepec, by im-\nplication,r loosen the control of the United States over the Western\nHemisphere. He approved of Chapter VIII, Section C, of the Dum-\nbarton Oaks Proposals as it stood, but did not agree that peace was\nindivisible, since he could think of local disputes particularly in\nLatin America, which had produced armed conflict.\n  GtNERAL FAIRCHILD stressed that there was nothing in paragraph\n2, Section C, Chapter VIII, which would prevent the Security Coun-\ncil from giving a general prior authority to a regional organization\nto act. If the Security Council acted in good faith, there was no\nreason why the Inter-American System could not appeal for prior\nauthority, where a local dispute did not threaten the peace of the\nworld. In that case a regional organization could go ahead without\nthe interference of the veto of an outside Great Power. He thought\nthis was a practical scheme. SENATOR CONNALLY said that this was\njust the point he had been trying to make. GENERAL FAIRCHILD stated\nthat a regional organization could go ahead as to pacific procedure\nas paragraph 2 stood and could obtain prior authority for the Council\nfor enforcement action. SENATOR VANDENBERG thought this was\nimplicit but not entirely apparent.\n  ADMIRAL WILLSON, at this point, indicated that the basic issue in-\nvolved in regionalism was whether stress was to be laid on the whole\nor-on the parts-whether the whole were to be greater than the parts\nthereof, or vice versa. While it was true, as Commander Stassen had\nstated, that China and France might have a veto as to Inter-American\nregional action, if China had no veto as to this hemisphere, then\nthe United States would have no veto as to any other parts of the\nworld. The Charter, he thought, was quite adequate as a basis for\ndiscussion at San Francisco.\n  ADMIRAL HEPBURN pointed out that the discussion really involved\nthe whole Charter of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. The Great\nPowers had decided to "stick together", and it was necessary to\nhave\nsome faith. He thought the chapter should stand as it was.
