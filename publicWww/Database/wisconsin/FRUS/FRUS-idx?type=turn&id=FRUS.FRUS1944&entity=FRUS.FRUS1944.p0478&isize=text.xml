During the active operational phase, activities of an economic\nciharacter conducted by the Allied Control Commission and other\nagencies in Italy under my command of necessity have been directly\nrelated to support of military operations. Supplies have been im-\nported and distributed to the civilian population in order to minimize\ndisease and prevent unrest, and efforts toward economic rehabilitation\nhave had the primary, if not the exclusive, purpose of utilizing Italy\'s\nresources for the war effort and producing in Italy goods which would\notherwise have had to be imported.\n  3. In the light of the changed operational situation the limited\ndirectives which have governed seem no longer to be adequate. The\nArmistice agreement, under which the Allied Control Commission\noperates, contains no commitment to the Italian people as to any\nmeasure of material assistance. However, there has arisen in Italy\nthe expectation, if not the assumption, presumably by reason of the\nknown humanitarian policies of the two governments, that an addi-\ntional measure of assistance and relief to the civil population would\nbe forthcoming. Public utterances in both countries have tended to\nsupport this view. Moreover, if the two governments continue at this\nstage to consider only what is required in the interest of the war effort,\nthey may lose the (:Opportunity of ensuring one of their own long term\ninterests, i.e., the establishment of a reasonably prosperous and con-\ntented Italy after the war. Notwithstanding this fact the standard\nof military necessity still obtains and in the provision of supply is\nbeing strictly adhered to. For example, a clothing programme was\nsubmitted in June (LAC airgram 32 2) based on the estimated essential\nneeds of the population this winter, but also having regard to the\nanti-inflationary effects of an increased supply of consumer goods. I\nam now asked, however, (CAL 738 2) to certify that this clothing is\nthe minimum requirement to prevent disease and unrest which would\nprejudice military operations. As another example, not of great im-\nportance in itself but indicating the type of question which is now\narising, in response to a requisition of paper essential for proper\nkeeping of Italian tax records, it is asked (CAL 566 2) whether the\npaper is necessary "to control and manage the civil population."\n  4. For the foregoing reasons I request that directives which govern\nthe provision of civilian supply and economic rehabilitation be re-\nexamined and that, if the policy of the governments is to furnish aid\nto Italy beyond that required by strict military necessity of the Allied\n2 NTot printed.\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0013.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0013.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0478&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0478&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0478&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0478&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0478&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0478&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0478&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0013.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0012&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0014&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0445&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0477&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0479&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0013.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0012&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0014&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0445&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0477&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0479&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0478&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
