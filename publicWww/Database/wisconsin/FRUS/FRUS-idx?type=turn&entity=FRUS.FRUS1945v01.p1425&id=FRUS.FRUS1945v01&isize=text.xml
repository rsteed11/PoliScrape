COMMANDER STASSEN declared\nthat he would attend the Committee meeting but would not himself\ncontact the head of the Greek Delegation. Commander Stassen was\nof the opinion that this should be done by a State Department Officer.\nREPRESENTATIVE BLOOM declared that Mr. Hickerson would see the\nGreek Ambassador.\n                           PREAMBLE\n  MR.

HACKWORTH declared that he did not\nremember the exact phraseology which would be used in this situa-\ntion. However, he repeated that the omission of the word "We"\nwould simplify the drafting problem. It had been concluded, how-\never, that the word "We" was untouchable. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE ob-\nserved that she should not think that it was true that "We" could\nnot\nbe dropped. Committee I/1 had recognized the difficulty involved\nin the constitutional requirements of some of the governments 31 and\nhad had the expectation that both the beginning and the ending of the\nPreamble would be subjected to considerable consideration from a\njuridical standpoint. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked whether the\n"punch" of the Preamble would not be destroyed if "We"\nwere to be\nomitted. MR. HACKWORTH pointed out that this wording would make\n  \'0 Doc.
