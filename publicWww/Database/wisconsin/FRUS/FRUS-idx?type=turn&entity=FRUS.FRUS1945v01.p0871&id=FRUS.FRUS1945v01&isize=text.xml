General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 809\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nthat the Council initiate the motion for such agreements. He con-\ncluded that the chief argument for joint negotiation is that we would\nknow before we ourselves pledge a contribution what was being\npledged by others.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG expressed the view that a contract directly\nwith the Security Council might have some advantages. MR. PAS-\nVOLSKY suggested that the provision for negotiating the agreements\nunder the auspices and on the initiative of the Security Council would\nappear to meet the situation. The probable procedure would be that\nthe Security Council, with the advice of the Military Staff Commit-\ntee, would prepare a plan as to what they thought would be satis-\nfactory. This would then be discussed by the members and agree-\nments would be reached, it being desirable to have as nearly as possible\na single instrument. The instrument, however, would become effec-\ntive for each country as ratified by each country. MR. ARMSTRONG\nasked whether we would be bound to make contributions before others\nhad pledged their forces. THE SECRETARY pointed out that such fun-\ndamental issues as had been raised by Mr. Armstrong should be\ndiscussed in a paper on this question which should be prepared for\ndiscussion on Monday in consultation with the Military Advisers.\nSENATOR VANDENBERG thought this was a most crucial problem that\nwould probably arouse longer debate in the Senate than any other is-\nsue. He believed that the question would be raised in this connection\nas to the power of the American delegate to commit us to the use of\nforce.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said the one difficulty he saw with the provi-\nsion that the agreement should be among the members was that no\nqualification could then be placed upon the power of the Security\nCouncil with respect to the conditions under which it could call upon\nthe forces pledged. MR. DULLES suggested the phrase simply "con-\ncluded by them". SENATOR VANDENBERG indicated that this would of\ncourse only postpone the argument. MR. DULLES remarked that this\nwording would have the advantage of making it possible to follow\neither course as circumstances indicated.\n          EXCEPTION FOR ACTION AGAINST ENEMY STATES\n  MR. PASVOLSKY stated that the question had been raised in the four-\npower discussion 28 whether the treaties of mutual assistance would\ndisappear when the powers of the Security Council were extended to\ncover action against enemy states. The French, he added, were par-\nticularly concerned about this question. MR. PASVOLSSKY noted that\nthe Soviet representatives thought the treaties would disappear.
