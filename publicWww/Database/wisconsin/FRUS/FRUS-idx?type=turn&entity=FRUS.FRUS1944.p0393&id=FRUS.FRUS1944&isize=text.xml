Conference at Quebec, 1944\n\t\t\t(1944)\n\n Proceedings of the conference,&#160;&#160; pp. 295-384\n\t\t\t\n PDF (32.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 333\n\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE\n333\nWhen the British Chiefs of Staff spoke of the main operations against\nJapan they did not intend to confine this meaning to Japan itself\ngeographically but meant rather that the fleet should take part in the\nmain operations within the theater of war wherever they might be\ntaking place.\n  SIR ANDREW CUNNINGHAM stressed that the British Chiefs of Staff\ndid not wish the British Fleet merely to take part in mopping up\noperations in areas falling into our hands.\n  ADMIRAL LEAIIY said that he felt that the actual operations in which\nthe British Fleet would take part would have to be decided in the ful-\nture. It might well be that the fleet would be required for the con-\nquest of Singapore, which he would regard as a major operation.\n  THE COMBINED CHIEFS oF STAFF then considered paragraph 2 of\nC.C.S. 452/27 referring to the use of a British Empire task force in\nthe Southwest Pacific.\n  SIR CCHARLES PORTAL said that the Prime Minister had offered the\nBritish Fleet for use in the main operations against Japan. By impli-\ncation this paragraph accepted a naval task force for the Southwest\nPacific, and was therefore contrary to the intention he had expressed.\n  ADMIRAL KING said that it was of course essential to have sufficient\nforces for the war against Japan. H-e was not, however, prepared to\naccept a British Fleet which he could not employ or support. In prin-\nciple he wished to accept the British Fleet in the Pacific but it would\nbe entirely unacceptable for the British main fleet to be employed\nfor political reasons in the Pacific and thus necessitate withdrawal of\nsome of the United States Fleet.\n  SIR CHARLES PORTAL reminded Admiral KiMng that the Prime Min-\nister had suggested that certain of the newer British capital ships\nshould be substituted for certain of the older U.S. ships.\n  Sip, ANDREW CUNNINGHAM said that as he understood it the Prime\nMinister and President were in agreement that it was essential for\nBritish forces to take a leading part in the main operations against\nJapan.\n  ADMIRAL KING said that it was not his recollection that the Presi-\ndent had agreed to this. He could not accept that a view expressed by\nthe Prime Minister should be regarded as a directive to the Combined\nChiefs of Staff.\n  SIR CHARLES PORTAL said that the Prime Minister felt it essential\nthat it should be placed on record that he wished the British Fleet to\nplay a major role in the operations against Japan.\n  SIR ALAN BRooKE said that, as he remembered it, the offer wleas no\nsooner made than accepted by the President.\n  ADMIRAL KING asked for specific British proposals.\n  SIR CHARLES PORTAL referred once more to the offer mrade in C.C.S.\n452/18 which he had had previously quoted.\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0393&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0393&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0393&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0393&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0393&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0393&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0393&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0392&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0394&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0392&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0394&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0393&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
