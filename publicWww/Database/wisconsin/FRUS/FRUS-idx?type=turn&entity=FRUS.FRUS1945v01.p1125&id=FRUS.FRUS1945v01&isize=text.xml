General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1063\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nquestion and remarked that the voting provisions would probably be\naccepted in any event but a number of states might not ratify the\nCharter when it was finished. MR. ROCKEFELLER thought that either\nCommander Stassen\'s suggestion or the proposal made by Mr. Dulles\nwould cover the situation. MR. DuLLEs remarked that he was very\nmuch afraid of establishing a precedent of reservations and COM-\nMANDER STASSEN declared; that Mr. Dulles\' proposal was agreeable\nto him. SENATOR VANDENBERG thought that a mistake had been made\nwhen there had been no provision made for a section on withdrawal\nin the Organization. He thought that "The Life of Henry Cabot\nLodge"   with special reference to the parts of the book pertaining\nto the Covenant of the League of Nations, proved his point.\n  COMMIANDER STASSEN thought that Mr. Dulles\' suggestion should\nbe presented for consideration on the lower levels of the Big Five.\nSECRETARY STETTINIuS declared, confidentially, that from that point\non there was no lower level; the Subcommittee of Five had been abol-\nished.45 All Big Five discussions would take place among the heads\nof Delegations in the Pent House. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM pointed\nto the Constitution of the United States as an example of what should\nbe incorporated in the Charter. He pointed out that the Constitu-\ntion did not permit withdrawal on the part of any state because it\ndid not find an amendment passed by the constitutional processes to\nbe acceptable. DEAN GILDERSLEEviE remarked that in her opinion a\nprovision making possible reservations would be troublesome and de-\nclared that she would favor a clause on withdrawal. SECRETARY\nSTETrINIus wondered why it was necessary to bring the question of\nreservation into the open. Any country, he declared, could make a\nreservation to an international agreement without express recogni-\ntion of that right. THE SECRETARY reiterated that the position of the\nUnited States be settled first. MR. ROCKEFELLER urged that the mat-\nter be settled now and that Mr. Dulles should present a draft of the\nstatement to be added to Representative Eaton\'s declaration in the\nrecords of the committee which was concerned with withdrawal. MR.\nDULIs remarked that such a statement was extraneous to the United\nStates position on the question of amendment and the convocation\nof a conference for the reviewing of the Charter and hence was not\nnecessary that evening. However, it was agreed that Mr. Dulles\nshould prepare a draft to present later on in the meeting.\n  4 Possible reference to The Gentleman from Massachusett8: Henry Cabot\nLodge, by Karl Schriftgiesser (Boston, 1944).\n  "5In his daily message of June 2 to President Truman and Mr. Hull\non de-\nvelopments of the Conference, Mr. Stettinius noted that "the so-called\nworking\ncommittee of the Big Five which has been doing excellent preparatory work\nunder the chairmanship of Dr. Pasvolsky has now been dissolved as a result\nof\nthe recall to Moscow of its Soviet memnber Sobolev. All further regular con-\nsultation among the Big Five therefore will take place among the chiefs of\ndelegations."
