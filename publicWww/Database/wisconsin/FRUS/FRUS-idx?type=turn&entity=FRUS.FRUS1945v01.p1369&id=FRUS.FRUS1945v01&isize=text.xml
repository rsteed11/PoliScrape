DiICKERSON observed that he was dissatisfied with the amend-\nment presented by Senator Rolin. Mr. Hickerson thought that the\nmore ratifications that were needed for any amendment, the weaker\nthe Organization would be. Mr. Hickerson admitted that there was\nno immediate difficulty to the United States involved in a requirement\nfor more ratifications because of the fact that the United States had\na veto over any amendments passed. He reported that one delegate\nhad told him that he was opposed to Senator Rolin\'s proposal but\nwould vote for it because he was tired of being "kicked around by\nthe Big Five".\n  SENATOR CONNALLY observed that he would have no objections to\nsetting the tenth year as the date for holding a conference unless the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly opposed such a conven-\ntion by a majority vote. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM pointed out that\neven if provision were made in the Charter for having a convention\nat a specific date, it would still be necessary to call such a convention\nby a procedural vote. MR. DULLES thought that Representative Bloom\n-was technically correct unless there could be established in advance a\ndefinite date, hour, and organization for such a conference. However,\nMr. Dulles thought that the question at issue was not a technical one,\nbut was the broad matter of ending the conference on a decent note.\nThe smaller states were not interested in technical questions. The\ndelegation was dealing, Mr. Dulles said, with a psychological prob-\nlem. SENATOR CONNALLY observed that Mr. Evatt wanted the con-\nvention to be called without any interference by the Security Council.\nTHE SECRETARY thought that so long as the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council had ultimate control of the amendments that went\ninto effect, the rest of the details could make very little difference.\nSECRETARY STETTINIUS suggested that the delegation settle on some\nformula. MR. DULLES observed that if the United States could nego-\ntiate on this question alone, choosing the appropriate time and taking\nadvantage of the best possible strategy, the entire question could be\nsettled in an hour\'s time. Mr. Dulles pointed out, however, that the\nUnited States was in partnership with the U.S.S.R. and with the\nother sponsoring governments. The greatest need, he said, was for\nflexibility but this would be impossible inasmuch as prior agreement\nwas required among the sponsoring governments and France. The\nposition of the Russian delegates was that all changes should be\nrejected. MR. ARMSTRONG pointed out that the Russians had given\ntheir approval to placing the convocation of a revisionary convention\non the agenda of the General Assembly. A number of nations had\nspoken in favor of this solution and if it had been put to a vote, it\nwould have been carried with approximately two abstentions.
