As he saw it, the possible withdrawal of units of the Fifth\nArmy to France would be dependent on the successful outcome of the\ncampaign in Italy.\n  ADMIRAL LEAHY asked if it was Sir Charles Portal's thought that\nthese forces should be retained in Italy if General Eisenhower was\nin need of them in France.\n  SIR CHARLES PORTAL pointed out that it was a question of short-term\nas opposed to long-term advantages. The important point as he saw\nit was to prevent the German troops getting away in north Italy if it\ncould be avoided.\n  ADMIRAL LEAIIY said it was not the intention to withdraw troops\nfrom the Fifth Army unless the German troops withdrew.\n  SIR CHARLES PORTAL said that he would point out that the with-\ndrawal of forces from an army had a greater effect on that army than\nthe actual number of formations withdrawn, since such withdrawals\nhad a discouraging effect on the morale of the command and of the\narmy itself.\n  ADMIRAL LEAIIY re-emphasized that the United States proposal was\ncontingent on the destruction or withdrawal of a large part of the\nGerman Army.\n  GENERAL MARSHALL said that there was no intention in the mind of\nthe United States Chiefs of Staff to effect the withdrawal of forces\nfrom Italy at the present time.\n  ADMIRAL KING confirmed that an option on the U.S. landing craft\nnow in the Mediterranean could be retained provided a decision was\nreached by 15 October.\n  In reply to a question by Sir Alan Brooke, GENERAL MARSSHALL con-\nfirmed that while there was no intention of moving major units of the\nFifth Army at the present time, small individual units (i.e., the\nJapanese battalion) might be withdrawn.\n  After further discussion,\n304\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
