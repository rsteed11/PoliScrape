There is a strong feeling on the part of\nsome of the representatives at the meeting of the Committee of Jurists\nthat the Court should have compulsory jurisdiction (that any govern-\nment should have the right to bring a case before the Court against\nany other government without the necessity for special agreements).\nThis would constitute a departure from the present statute under\nwhich it is made optional with the parties to the statute of the Court\nto accept compulsory jurisdiction generally or on the basis of reci-\nprocity. This was left for decision at San Francisco.\n  The provisions in the statute authorizing the Assembly and the\nCouncil of the League of Nations to call upon the Court for advisory\nopinions has been retained as was contemplated by the Dumbarton\nOaks Proposal, substituting the General Assembly and the Security\n,Council of the new organization for the comparable bodies of the\nLeague.\n  There was a wide difference of view in the Committee on the ques-\ntion of the nomination of the judges. At present the nominations are\nmade by the representatives of the various countries on the panel of\nthe Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague under a convention\nof 1907 74 and by similar groups set up for that purpose by countries\nthat are not parties to The Hague convention. There was consider-\nable support in the Committee for having these nominations made\n  T3 For the "Record of the Meeting of the Committee of Jurists for\nthe Prepara-\ntion of a Draft of a Statute for the International Court of Justice to be\nSub-\nmitted to the United Nations Conference on International Organization",\nsee\nThe International Court of Justice, pp. 98-133.\n  For full documentation of the meeting of the Committee of Jurists, see\nUNCIO\nDocuments, vol. 14.\n  74 For text of convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes\nconcluded October 18, 1907, at The Hague, see Foreign Relations, 1907, pt.\n2,\nP. 1181.\n362\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
