General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 818\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG urged that Senator Connally\'s suggestion be\nadopted to substitute the word "until" for "before".\nTHE SECRETARY\nagreed that this was a great improvement. MR. PASVOLSKY suggested\nthat a comnma after the -words "member state" be added. General\nagreement was expressed with these two modifications.\n  MR. HACKWORTH expressed the view that the present draft greatly\nqualified the right of self-defense by limiting it to the occasion of an\narmed attack. MR. STASSEN stated that this was intentional and\nsound. We did not want exercised the right of self-defense before\nan armed attack had occurred.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY pointed out that in the Subcommittee of Five there\nhad been some question whether the phrase "maintain international\npeace and security" was satisfactory. It was felt that since an attack\ninvolved a breach of the peace that the reference should be to "main-\ntain or restore international peace and security."\n  THE SECRETARY asked Mr. Pasvolsky what procedure would be\nfollowed in having these changes adopted. MR. PASVOLSKY stated\nthat he was meeting at 5: 00 o\'clock with the Subcommittee of Five\nand would talk these questions over and report at 6: 00 o\'clock to the\nMeeting of the Five. THE -SECRETARY -asked whether Mr. Pasvolsky\nthought the changes being suggested would be acceptable. MR.\nPASVOLSKY remarked that he had every reason to believe they would\nbe acceptable, although he did not like to commit himself prior to\nthe discussions. THE SECRETARY asked whether after the 6: 00 o\'clock\nmeeting it would probably be necessary to wait five days for a reply\nfrom the Soviet Union. MR. PASVOLSKY thought that the Soviet\nrepresentative would accept the paragraph today. He thought they\nhad authority to close the issue and said he would be willing to so bet.\nSENATOR VANDENBERG stated that he would move anyway the next\nday at noon and that that was final.35 MR. DULLES suggested that\nMr. Pasvolsky\'s proposal be adopted to use the phrase "adequate\nmeasures to maintain or restore international peace and security."\nThis was generally agreed to.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY suggested that the addition might be made\nin the first sentence of the words "or its exercise" after the\nword\n"self-defense". He thought it might be wise to thus double the\ncon-\ncept in the first sentence. ADMIRAL HEPBURN thought this was im-\nplicit. M-IR. HACKWORTH indicated that there was something to the\nsuggestion. MR. STASSEN questioned whether, in view of the fact\nthat we had been working on this draft for so long, it was now wise\nto monkey with the wording unless it was absolutely necessary. SEN-\n- Senator Vandenberg presented the Five-Power formula to the Subcommittee\nof Committee 111/4 on May 21; Australia, France, and Czechoslovakia urged\nac-\nceptance of the proposals, but Egypt asked for 24 hours\' delay; minutes not\nprinted (US 111/4/A Doe. 9, May 21).\n818\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0880&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0880&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0880&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0880&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0880&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0880&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0880&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0879&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0881&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0879&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0881&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0880&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
