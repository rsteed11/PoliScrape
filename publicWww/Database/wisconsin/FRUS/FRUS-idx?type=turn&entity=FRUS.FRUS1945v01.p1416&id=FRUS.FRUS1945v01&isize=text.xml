The successful efforts which we have\nmade to maintain the Yalta voting procedure and the veto power of\nthe five permanent members on amendments to the Charter, both of\nwhich have not [now?] been approved by the appropriate committees\nof the conference, have created a situation in the conference which\nwould make it even more difficult than that [which] obtained on the\n29th of May when the texts mentioned above were approved.\n  We have known for several days that Gromyko was dissatisfied\nwith the decision of the committee and yesterday he asked that a\nmeeting of the Executive Committee and the Steering Committee\nbe arranged in order that he might make a statement in regard to\nthe question. Meetings of the Executive Committee and the Steering\nCommittee were held today. The text of the statement which Gro-\nmyko made as well as the statement made by Manuilsky, Chairman\nof the IJkrainian Delegation, are being telegraphed to you in a separate\nmessage.'7\n  Immediately after Gromyko's statement in the two committees,\nEvatt, the Australian Foreign Minister, made a strong statement de-\nfending the action of the Technical Committee. Evatt's statement was\nwarmly applauded in the Steering Committee which, as you know, is\ncomposed of the heads of all delegations at the conference.\n  A subcommittee consisting of Gromyko, Evatt and myself was\nappointed to consider this matter. The subcommittee has held three\nmeetings today. At the last meeting Evatt put forward informally\na suggested new paragraph 1 to replace the approved committee text,\nreading as follows:\n  '1. The General Assembly should have the right to discuss any matters covered\nby the purposes and principles of the Charter or within the sphere of action\nof\nthe United Nations or relating to the powers and functions of any of its\norgans\nor otherwise within the scope of the Charter; and, except as provided in\npara-\ngraph 2(b) of this section, to make recommendations to the members of the\nUnited Nations or to the Security Council or both on any such questions or\nmatter.'\n  Evatt said that he was prepared to sponsor this text; that he be-\nlieved approval of it could be obtained.\n  Gromyko had expressed strong opposition to the phrase 'within the\nsphere of international relations' in the text approved by the com-\nmittee on May 29. Evatt's new draft omits these words.\n  Gromyko had also expressed the fear that the wide powers of dis-\ncussion in the committee draft might permit debate in the General\nAssembly of questions within the domestic jurisdiction of sovereign\nstates. We believe that he is now satisfied that another provision of\nthe Charter contained in the principles adequately covers this point.\nThat article says that 'nothing contained in this Charter shall author-\nize the organization to intervene in matters which are essentially\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the mem-\nbers to submit such matters to settlement under this Charter . .\n  Gromyko stated that he would telegraph the Evatt proposal to Mos-\ncow and request instructions.\n  7 Telegram 4, June 13, to the Acting Secretary of State, repeated to Moscow\nas\ntelegram 1333, June 18, 7 a. m., not printed;
