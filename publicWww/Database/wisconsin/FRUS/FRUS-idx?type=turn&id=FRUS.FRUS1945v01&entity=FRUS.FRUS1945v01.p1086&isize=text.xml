General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1024\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nbeen some opposition in Committee III/3 to the draft chapter as it\nwas prepared by the Big Four powers.\'4 It had been argued that the\nwording was not clear and that clarification was necessary. The\nCanadian Delegation, which had been the chief source of opposition,\npresented a substitute draft to the subcommittee, although this had\nproved unacceptable because it made substantive changes in the\nmeaning whereas the subcommittee was empowered only to clarify the\nexisting meaning. As a result, Mr. Hickerson had presented a draft\nwhich the Russians had declared that they could not accept.\n  THE SECEmTARY asked Mr. Pasvolsky whether he could not first\npresent the picture of those questions which would require decision\nshortly.\'5 MR. PASVOLSKY replied that an amendment on the revision\nof treaties would probably be proposed shortly, and he was of the\nopinion that the United States should oppose any such move. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG declared that it seemed to be a rather confused situation\nbecause Chile was opposed to such a movement while Bolivia had\nindicated strong support. MU. Du-LTES voiced an opinion that re-\nvision of treaties was the result of the suppression of the South Ameri-\ncan proposals to sanctify regional arrangements. MR. PASVOLSHKY\nreplied that in his opinion it was essential for the United States to\noppose such a move, and iSENATOR VANDENBERG agreed that this Gov-\nernment should stand by its commitment to the other members of the\nBig Five.\n  MR. PAsVomsKcY reported that there were several matters being con-\nsidered in Committee 11/2 which were bothering the Russians. The\nchief one was the definition of the terminology "sphere of inter-\nnational relations".\'0  SENATOR VANDENBERG commented that the mat-\nter had been argued the previous afternoon and that the United States\nhad voted on the side of the Russians and had been voted down\n"eloquently and enthusiastically". SENATOR VANDENBERG voiced the\nopinion that this measure could not be reopened with any possibility\nof success. MR. PASVOLSKY advanced the view that the question would\nundoubtedly be raised again.\n  At this point THE SECRETARY asked on what issue it was that the\nRussians had claimed that the United States had voted against its\ncommitments. MR. SANDiFER replied that the item referred to was\nChapter V, Section B, Paragraph 8 for which Senator Vandenberg\nhad voted favorably.\'7 The Delegation was referred to the draft of\nthis paragraph, approved by Committee I1/2 (United States docu-\n" Doc. 704, III/3/36, May 31, UNCIO Documents, vol. 12, p. 400.\n15 For a list of questions of principle involved in proposed amendments relating\nto chapter V, B, 6, see Doc. 416, II/2/A/3, May 18, ibid., vol. 9, p. 346.\nl\' Doe. 686, 11/2/34, May 30, ibid., p. 109.\n1" Doe. 707, II/2/26, May 31, ibid., p. 115.\n1024\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1086&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1086&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1086&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1086&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1086&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1086&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1086&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1085&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1087&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1085&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1087&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1086&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
