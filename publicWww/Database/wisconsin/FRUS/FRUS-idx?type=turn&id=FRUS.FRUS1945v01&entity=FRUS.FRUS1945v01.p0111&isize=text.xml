PASVOLSKY thought that intervention by the Council\nshould not be limited to the situation in which the parties had failed\nto reach a settlement, but that it should have the authority to inter-\nvene if it considered that the procedures under paragraph 3 were not\nbeing carried out with sufficient vigor.\nTouching again upon paragraph 6, he stated that the assumption\nthere was that a justiciable dispute would go to the Court, and other\ntypes of dispute to the Security Council. In case of question as to,\nwhether a dispute was justiciable, he said it was intended that the\nCourt would decide whether it should take jurisdiction. The Council\ncould also request the opinion of the Court on legal questions con-\nnected with other disputes.\n  Referring to the Brazilian commentary on this paragraph DR.\nPASVOLSKY stated that here again two questions were involved: (1)\ncould the Council refer a dispute to the Court and (2) could it refer\na case to arbitration? He said it was important to keep in mind that\nat this stage the Council could recommend procedures and methods\nand not employ methods itself unless the parties to a dispute asked\nthe Council to settle the case for them, in which event the Council\nwould become an agency of mediation. With reference to the first\nquestion, he said that discussion must be deferred until the statute of\nthe Court was determined; as to the second, that the Council had\ninherent rights in the matter but if it was found desirable to specify\nmethods which the Council must employ, then that might be\nconsidered.\n  He explained that the point raised by Venezuela in connection with\nparagraph 6 brought up the question of whether the procedures\ndescribed under paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 should be under the Assembly\nas well as the Security Council. The Venezuelan commentary on\nthe same paragraph, DR. PAsvoLsKY pointed out, related to! the ques-\ntion of compulsory jurisdiction and therefore must also be held over\nfor discussion in connection with the Court statute.\n  Paragraph 7, he said, referred to a problem which needed to be very\nthoroughly explored in later detailed discussions, particularly with\nrespect to who should determine whether a particular matter lay solely\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of the state concerned. He referred\nin this connection to Mexico\'s commentary to the effect that this para-\ngraph should be eliminated. He inquired of the Ambassador of\nChile what was meant by the phrase "already solved by treaties in\nforce" as used in Chile\'s commentary on the paragraph in question.\nTHE AMBASSADOR replied that it referred to the same question, al-\nready discussed, of respect for treaties.\n  Passing to Section B. DR. PASVOLSIY stated that Uruguay\'s com-\nmentary on the first paragraph was in line with the Proposals.
