AMBASSADOR GROMYKO indicated that abstention meant a\nnegative vote. MR. PASVOLSKY agreed and said that the basic theory\nof the Dumbarton Oaks document was that abstention was not pos-\nsible for the permanent members. Abstention by a permanent mem-\nber meant that the Council could not proceed.\n  MR. STErrINIUS stated that there was no such thing as abstention\nfor the permanent members, in effect, but only the absence of an\naffirmative vote.\n  MR. BoNcCOU said that he would agree with the others as long as\nit was understood that there was no right of abstention for the per-\nmanent members and so long as it was clear that the Security Council\ncould proceed in the settlement of disputes when a permanent member\nparty to a dispute abstained.\n  Mi. STEnwINIuS called on Mr. Armstrong to present the third item\non the agenda, the problem of withdrawal.\n  AIR. ARMSTRONG said that a serious question had arisen in Com-\nmittee I/2 that was knownR to all the delegations. He wished to sug-\ngest that it was important to consolidate the position of the Five in\norder to ward off opposition. In the first place, there was the prob-\nlem as to whether we wanted to deal with the question of withdrawal\nfrom a general point of view or linked with amendments. The second\nproblem was to make sure that the special conference called to review\nthe Charter was not left free to determine its own rules of procedure\nand the method of ratification. Third, the question still had to be\ndealt with as to the time for the holding of the conference in view\nof the vote already taken in the subcommittee that the conference be\nheld within a five- to ten-year period. In the fourth place, the ques-\ntion of the retention of a provision for expulsion remained open. MR.\nARMSTRONG explained that it was agreed that all these questions were\ninterlocked and that it was time to adopt a procedure that would make\nit possible for us to get the most that we wanted.\n  MR. ARMSTRONG stated that this matter had been thought over and\ndiscussed by the American Delegation at considerable length. The\nviews of the five delegations were not yet fully clear with respect to\nthe matter of withdrawal. The United States Delegation had put\nforward the suggestion that the date for the calling of the conference\nmight be handled by placing the subject on the agenda of the tenth\nAssembly if previous to that time a conference had not been held.\nMoreover, he said, it was understood that some states wished to link\nthe withdrawal clause to the amendment procedure by a statement in\nthe committee report. In the light of this possibility a statement had\nbeen prepared.
