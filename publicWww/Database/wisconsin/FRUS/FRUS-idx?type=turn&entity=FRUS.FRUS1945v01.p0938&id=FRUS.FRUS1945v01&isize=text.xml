General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 876\n\n\nFOREIGN RELTI;ONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\nto recommend unanimously that a dispute, be settled by judicial means\nbut he declared it would be impossible to guarantee unanimity all the\nway through the various stages leading up to the use of force. This\nhe declared was a brilliantly conceived statement but it served only\nto emphasize the impossibility of the United States\' position in de-\nfending the Yalta voting arrangements.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked what course of action the United States\ncould take-would it be possible to change the Yalta, agreement?\nMR. PASVOLSKY replied that the United States could take any position\nit desired. COMMANDER STASSEN suggested that we attempt to accept\nthe position taken by Sir Alexander Cadogan that peaceful settlement\nbe made a procedural matter. SENATOR CONNALLY declared that the\nUnited States Delegation. had not been in unanimous agreement as to\nthe advisability of this course. Ma. DULLES inquired whether the\nDelegation wanted the United States to be placed in the position of\nhaving to use-force without having adequate opportunity to examine\nthee possibilities and make its own choice. MR. DULLES thought that\n\'this was a bad paper because it was an attempt to justify logically\nsomething which was logically.indefensible. He went on to suggest\nthat any statement made should emphasize the chronological sequence\nwhereby unanimity had been required under the League of Nations\nand progress had been made in the Charter of the proposed organi-\nzation although perfection had not yet been-reached.. MR. D\'ULLES\nwas.strongly opposed to any attempt to justify the existing formula\nlogically in this draft statement. He said even the initiation of an\ninvestigation by the Organization would. seem to obligate all the\nparties to go all the way to the end process, the use of force. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG remarked that it was like the person who would not\ngo to a doctor unless he was ready for the undertaker.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN maintained that there was great benefit to be\nderived from getting at all the facts in a situation. It was necessary,\nhe said, to get the facts out first, after which each nation could decide\nfor itself whether it wanted to take further action. At this point,\nMR. PAsVOLSKY pointed out that through inadvertence a phrase had\nbeen left out of the sentence referred to by Mr. Dulles previously.\nAfter the last word of the sentence as it appeared, should be added:\n"tunless it is itself a party to a dispute." SENATOR VANDENBERG\nde-\nclared that although this met part of Mr. Dulles\' objection it did not\nimprove the logic of the entire statement.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY declared that emphasis should be laid on the\nfact that this provision for unanimity among the great powers in\nthe imposition of force went beyond the requirements of the League\nof Nations for complete unanimity. MR. DuLLEs remarked that there\nwas no reason to consider the Organization from the hypothesis that\nthe permanent members were going to exercise their veto power arbi-\n876\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0939&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0939&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
