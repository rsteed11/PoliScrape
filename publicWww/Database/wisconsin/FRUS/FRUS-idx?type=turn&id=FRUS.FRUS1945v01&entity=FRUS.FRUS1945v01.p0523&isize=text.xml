STASSEN suggested that then Delegates present should now\ntake up some of the deferred items that had not yet been dealt with.\nHe thought everyone was present who was concerned with the Pre-\namble. MR. GERIG suggested that the Arrangements for Economic\nand -Social Cooperation had better be taken up and that it would\nbe a good idea to wait with the Preamble. MR. DULLES said this could\nbe taken up better than some other questions.\n  Miss GILDERSLEEVE said that before this was discussed she wanted\nto clarify the status of the official text in the light of the Russian\napproval of the Chinese proposals.56 She asked whether this made\nthe official text different. MR. GERIG said there was a revised draft\nof Chapter IX57 being proposed which took account of the sug-\ngestions that the Chinese Government had made at Dumbarton Oaks.\nMIR. STASSEN said it was his understanding that the three Chinese\nproposals now had -the same status as the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals\nthemselves.\n  MR. GERIG asked whether they should be treated as a separate para-\ngraph or woven into the text of the document. ! REPRESENTATIVE\nBLooM commented that Miss Gildersleeve, himself, and Representa-\ntive Eaton were on this committee58..\n  MR. BOWMAN recalled that the Advisers had put before, the Delega-\ntion in Washington a program -on this- subject and that this program\nhad been discussed and some revisions- had been suggested. He asked\nwhether the text had been redrafted, and MR. NOER said it had been.\nMR. BOWMAN said that. the groupothat had discussed the matter was\nhere,_ and REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM, said that they should come in . to\nlisten to the discussion now. MR. BOWMAN asked if it would be all\nright to open the discussion again. MR. STASSEN thought that the\nDelegates could discuss the draft more intelligently if these people\nwere available and if the Delegates could have their views.\n  MR. NOTTER said that ordinarily Mr. Stettinius decides when an\nexecutive session should be held, and MR. BOWMAN added that the\ngroup present had to decide in his absence. MR. STASSEN said that\n-unless there was some objection,. he would call in the Economic and\nSocial Advisers and Experts. Mr. Gerig sent for them.\n' FPor Chinese proposal, see telegram 619, March 16, 11 p. m., to Moscow,\np. 126; also, UNCIO Documents, vol. 3, p. 25; for Soviet approval of Chinese\nproposal, see minutes of first consultative meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers,\nApril 23, p. 363.\n   U.S. Doe.
