General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 457\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\naccept the proposition upon which the United States Delegation could\nobtain the most votes.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN said that in his opinion the question of equal\nauthority and rank of the four nations was involved. MR. DUNN\nadded that the Soviet Delegation wanted four equal Presidents so\nthat no one could act without the approval of the other three. MR.\nSTASSEN suggested that it might be wise to find out if the Soviet Dele-\ngation would accept the Eden compromise. If the Soviets would not,\nthen, he suggested, the United States Delegation might deternine\nwhether it could obtain the necessary votes for the original United\nStates proposal. He further stated that he thought the Secretary\nshould make a clear statement in the Steering Committee meeting\nthat no question of rank was involved in these matters. Furthermore,\nCOMMANDER STASSEN thought it might be helpful if the Secretary\nwould get in touch with the Soviet Delegation at once.\n  THE SECRETARY then asked for further opinions on this matter of\nthe Advisers to the Delegation, with the following results:\n  MESSRS. PASVOLSKY and HARRITMAN said that if the Soviet Delega-\ntion did not get its way in this question, there was a possibility that\nthey might withdraw from their position as a sponsoring power in\norder that they might have a free hand in the Conference.\n  MR. HACKWORTH pointed out that the same situation had been faced\nin the Committee of Jurists in Washington; that the Soviet represent-\native there would not serve as one of the three Vice Presidents after\nthe Soviet proposal for four chairmen of the Committee had been\ndefeated.53\n  MESSRS. GATES and DULLES agreed that it might be better to delay\nthe vote in the Steering Committee the next day in order to gain\ntime to consider the situation and mobilize support for the United\nSta"s proposal.\n  At this point Mr. Hiss entered the meeting and THE SECRETARY\ninquired as to- whether there was any possibility of a misunderstand-\ning the previous evening when Mr. Hiss had conveyed to the British\nDelegation the views of the United States Delegation on the British\nproposal. MR. Hiss said that he thought that he had clearly stated\nthe situation to Sir Alexander Cadogan and that there was no doubt\nin his mind at the time that the British Delegation clearly understood\nwhat the views of the United States Delegation were in the matter.\n  THE SECRETARY said that it was his sense of the discussion that the\nUnited States Delegation was willing to accept the compromise ad-\nvanced by Mr. Eden but that, in the opinion of the Delegation, it\nwould be better to go back to the original United States proposal.\n  5 See exchange of notes on this subject by the United States and the Soviet\nUnion, April 11 and 14, pp. 269 and 291, respectively.\n4.57\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
