General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 725\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nquestion was in the minds of the Latin Americans whether the changed\ncircumstances since Mexico City have affected our decision. Doubt\nwas raised in their mind by our position to exempt the European\ntreaties directed against enemy states. SENATOR CONNALLY advocated\nthat we hold to our position.\n  THE SECRETARY asked what had happened to account for the lack\nof faith of our Latin American friends in the General Organization.\nMR. ROCKEFELLER replied that he personally had stood for nothing but\nwhat was in the interest of the United States. He favored only what\nwas to our interests. THE SECRETARY asked whether he would also be\nwilling to say that the world organization was a matter of primary\ninterest to us. MR. ROCKEFEiLLER said he did believe that a world or-\nganization was essential for our, interests. TIE SECRETARY asked\nwhether Mr. Rockefeller could get our Southern friends to say this.\nMR. ROCKEEILLER replied in the affirmative noting that recently seven\nof those countries had voted against their own instructions.\n  AMR. DUNN explained that three events had affected the attitude of\nthe Latin Americans; one, the decisions taken at Yalta, two, hard\nsledding with the Soviet Union after they got to the CQnference and\nthree, the special exemptions for European treaties. These events\ndisturbed them and raised the question of our own confidence in the\nInter-American System. MR. DUNN felt that there was no question\nbut what the Latin American representatives would prefer to have\nfull faith in the Geoera1 Organization.\n  .Th SECRETARYreported that Mr. Savage had just talked to Mr.\nHull. Mr. Hull had -expressed the opinion that if we cannot check\nthe tendency towards regional and national self protection the inter-\nnationalorganization will gradually fade away. SENATOR VANDEN-\nBERG pointed out that he had consistently stressed global unity. THE\nSECRETARY added that he had done this also. SENATOR VANDENBERG\nreplied that it was more significant that he had done it since he was\nthe "old isolationist"!\n  MR. IIACKWORTH asked for one moment to present his opinion. He\nsuggested the possibility of having Mr. Padilla as President of the\nMexican Conference\'10 write to the Secretary asking him how it was\nnow intended toimplement the provision in the Act of Chapultepec,\nthat it should be integrated with the General Organization. He sug-\ngested that the Secretary could then reply to Mr. Padilla that we\nintend to carry out the policy \'agreed to, and accordingly, a confer-\nence would be called in the near future. MR. ROCKEFELLER thought\nthis was not a had idea and SENATOR VANDENBERG and THE SECRETARY\nindicated a favorable reaction.\n  10 Ezequiel Padilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mexico, served as\nperma-\n  nent President of the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and\nPeace,\nMexico City, February 21-March 8, 1945.\n725\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0786&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0786&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
