The method of dealing with these and other crim-\ninals requires careful thought and a well-defined procedure. Such pro-\ncedure must embody, in my judgment, at least the rudimentary aspects\nof the Bill of Rights, namely, notification to the accused of the charge,\nthe right to be heard and, within reasonable limits, to call witnesses in\nhis defense. I do not mean to favor the institution of state trials or to\nintroduce any cumbersome machinery but the very punishment of these\nmen in a dignified manner consistent with the advance of civilization,\nwill have all the greater effect upon posterity. Furthermore, it will\nafford the most effective way of making a record of the Nazi system\nof terrorism and of the effort of the Allies to terminate the system and\nprevent its recurrence.\n  I am disposed to believe that at least as to the chief Nazi officials,\nwe should participate in an international tribunal constituted to try\nthem. They should be charged with offences against the laws of the\nRules of War in that they have committed wanton and unnecessary\ncruelties in connection with the prosecution of the war. This law of the\nRules of War has been upheld by our own Supreme Court and will be\nthe basis of judicial action against the Nazis.\n  Even though these offences have not been committed against our\ntroops, I feel that our moral position is better if we take our share in\ntheir conviction. Other war criminals who have committed crimes in\nsubjugated territory should be returned in accordance with the Moscow\nDeclaration 6 to those territories for trial by national military commis-\nsions having jurisdiction of the offence under the same Rules of War.\nI have great difficulty in finding any means whereby military com-\nnissions may try and convict those responsible for excesses committed\nwithin Germany both before and during the war which have no relation\nto the conduct of the war. I would be prepared to construe broadly\nwhat constituted a violation of the Rules of 'War but there is a certain\nfield in which I fear that external courts cannot move. Such courts\nwould be without jurisdiction in precisely the same way that any\nforeign court would be without jurisdiction to try those who were\nguilty of, or condoned, lynching in our own country.\n   The above are the two main points with which I differ from the\nproposed program submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury.\nPartit ion\n   I have an open mind on partition and although I have given the\n matter substantial consideration I have, as yet, come to no conclusion\n 6 i.e., the Declaration of German Atrocities approved at the Tripartite\nCon-\n ference held at Moscow, October 18-November 1, 1943.
