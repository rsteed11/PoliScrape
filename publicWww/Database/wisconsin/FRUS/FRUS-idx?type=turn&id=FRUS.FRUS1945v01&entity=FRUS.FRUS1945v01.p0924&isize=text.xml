The members of the Delegation\nwere presented with a document entitled Recommendations on Basic\nIssues, U. S. Gen. 147,79 and were referred to the section on the work\nof Committee III/3 concerning agreements for the provision of\nforces to the Organization. The question at issue involved the word-\ning of paragraph 5, Section B, Chapter VIII. MR. HICKERSON stated\nthat it had been proposed to substitute the words "by them" for\nthe\noriginal wording "among themselves". This new wording would\nmake possible conclusion of agreements among any of a number of\npossible parties, such as the Security Council on the one hand and\nthe member states on the other, or the member states themselves.\nSENATOR CONNALLY asked who would determine the parties to any\nagreement, and MR. HICKERSON thought that this function would be\nperformed by the Security Council. SENATOR VANDENBERG indicated\nthat he had no objection to the proposed change, but SENATOR CON-\nNALLY declared that he was afraid that confusion might result from\nthe two possible situations. He himself, he said, would prefer to see\nthe agreements consummated with the Security Council as a party,\nand he asked MR. GATES to give the opinion of the military representa-\ntives on this subject. The latter said that he did not have a strong\nopinion on the subject but he agreed with Senator Connally that the\nSecurity Council should be a party to all military agreements. At\nthis point MR. HICKERSON pointed out that Admiral Train had drafted\na paper sometime previously proposing wording that would make\npossible Security Council participation in all military agreements.\nThe wording under consideration would provide for such a possibility.\nCOMMANDER STASSEN said that he, too, would support the change.\n  MIR. PASVOLSKY urged that it would be impossible to get agree-\nmnent on one alternative or the other, and that the most that could be\nhoped for would be a flexible solution making possible either alterna-\ntive. There had already been agreement to grant to the Security\n78 The Secretary of State was in Washington for consultations with President\nTruman.\n7 Not printed.
