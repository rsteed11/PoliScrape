General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 264\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nand Social Council was not one of spelling out in detail the objectives\nwhich it should pursue. The main point, he thought, was to make sure\nthat the Economic and Social Council will have such objectives as will\nenable it to keep the specialized organizations on a consistent track.\nHe pointed out in this connection that the Economic and Social Coun-\ncil is not intended to be an action body, but rather an advisory and\ncoordinating body.\n  With regard to the general view of the Delegation that the Charter\nof the Organization should be in broad general terms, MR. Cox sug-\ngested that if pressure should develop at San Francisco for the in-\nclusion of detailed objectives, we should take the position that the\nCharter, being a constitution, should be general, and that detailed\nquestions should be handled in a separate document which would be\nanalogous to a statute. If the pressure is very great it might be pos-\nsible to reach agreement at San Francisco on such a statutory docu-\nment, which might be appended to the Charter.\n  MR. WHITEI remarked that for the reason that they deal with details,\nstatutes need careful consideration by a special body. It did not seem\nwise to attempt to negotiate such statutes at San Francisco. He agreed,\nhowever, that it would be a good idea to resist the pressure which might\ndevelop at San Francisco by insisting on the constitutional approach.\n  In response to a question from Mr. Taft, MR. PASVOLSKY stated that\nit was the President's plan to set up a commission at San Francisco\nwhich would prepare for the first meeting of the General Assembly.\nThis commission would be purely preparatory and recommendatory\nand would not have the powers necessary to make it a satisfactory\nmechanism through which agreement might be reached on detailed\nstatutory agreements of the kind referred to by Mr. Cox or provided\nfor in the recommendations of the Executive Committee.\n  MNR. WARING remarked that if the anticipated pressure does in fact\ndevelop at San Francisco the rest of the world may be disappointed\nif the American Delegation does not have some detailed views on the\nEconomic and Social Council. He thought that we should be pre-\npared to meet the views of other countries half way if we cannot make\nour own prevail entirely.\n  MN. TAFr thought, with regard to the preparatory commission re-\nferred to by Mr. Pasvolsky, that it might be possible to establish\na subcommission to which might be entrusted the job of reaching agree-\nment on detailed objectives in economic and social matters.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG, referring to the question of pressures from\nother countries at San Francisco, thought that these would be less\nimportant than the pressures which would come from groups at home.\nHe stated that the CIG intended to present a detailed program at San\nFrancisco and that our only defense would be the constitutional ap-\nproach suggested by Mr. Cox and Mr. White.\n264\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
