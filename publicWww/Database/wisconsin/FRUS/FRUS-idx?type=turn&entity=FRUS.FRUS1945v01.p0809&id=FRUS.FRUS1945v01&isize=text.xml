BOWMAN said that this was a standard French legalism spelled\nout. It was partly a matter of holding down the tendency to support\nthe movement by Senator Vandenberg to bring treaties under review.\nHe thought they also had in mind the possibility of getting certain\ntreaties signed before the Charter goes into effect, especially treaties\nin\nthe Near East, including one with Syria before the mandate is trans-\nferred or Synra made independent. He thought it was not so much\na great moral principle that the French were trying to establish, as\na measure to consolidate their own position through these treaties.\nIt was essentially a combination of French foreign policy and French\nlegalism.\n  DEAN GILDERSLKEVE said that the French proposal was one that\nit would be difficult to stand up and object to. MR. BOWMAN said he\nliked the phrase "due respect for treaties." COMMANDER STASSEN\nsaid that he agreed with the idea of putting this statement into the\nPreamble rather than in the Chapter on Purposes or the one on Prin-\nciples. DEAN GILDERSLEEvE and REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said they\ndid not agree with this recommendation.\n  The Delegation voted 4 to 2 for approving the recommendation\nof the Committee of Five that reference to "due respect for treaties\nshould be put into the Preamble and that any reference to human\nrights, which has been associated with this point, should be handled\nseparately." It was also agreed that there should be no other refer-\nence in the Charter to respect for treaties.\n  MR. BOWMAN said that we should not stand for inclusion in the\nphraseology of the Charter of any general philosophical language\nabout the sanctity of treaties. REPRESENTATIVE BLooM asked if they\nwanted a statement on treaties in both Principles and Purposes. MR.\nNkxrral said that the French wanted to put it into the Chapter on Pur-\nposes. COMMANDER STASSEN said they did not want it in the section\non Peaceful Settlement. MR. NO-TTER said that the French representa-\ntive in the Committee of Five did not give the reasons for the French\nposition, but he had said he would recommend to his Delegation that\nthey agree to putting the reference to the observance of treaties in\nthe Preamble. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said in that case he would have\nthe recommendation read "only in the Preamble." He said that he\nwould like to reconsider the matter and have this phrase included.\nThis point was agreed to by the Delegation.\n  MR. No\'rR presented point C of the recommendations for Commit-\ntee I/1. ["The recommendation of the Committee of Five, that the\nAustralian proposal should be accepted, is recommended.
