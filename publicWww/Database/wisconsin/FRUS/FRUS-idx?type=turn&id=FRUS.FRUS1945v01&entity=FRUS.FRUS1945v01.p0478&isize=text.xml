However, it would be better not to\ninclude it at this point. Moreover, he thought it would be best\nfor the United States not to take the initiative, but to wait to see\nwhat other countries had to propose on this point.\n  Mr. Notter commented that under the present language the General\nAssembly had the power to consider without the power to put recom-\nmendations into effect. The General Assembly could state principles\nwithout imposing an obligation to live up to them. If the General\nAssembly had no power to formulate treaties for submission to the\nmembers, then it could only talk and not really do anything.

He said he did not\nintend to discuss the question of Argentina with Molotov. Others\nmight do it, but the United States would not. Before going, how-\never, he needed the quick reaction of the American Delegation.\n  Representative Bloom said that he had understood from Assistant\nSecretary Rockefeller that the South American Republics wanted\nArgentina to sign the United Nations Declaration.
