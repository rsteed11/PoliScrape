PASVOLSKY thought, however, that the statement suggested by\nSenator Rolin was "a monstrosity". Rather than accept this mon-\nstrosity, Mr. Pasvolsky said he would favor a withdrawal clause,\nbut Mr. Pasvolsky pointed out that it would be impossible for the\nDelegation to support such an amendment without obtaining the au-\nthorization of the President.  MR. DITLLES remarked that the Presi-\ndent had stated his position as opposing United States support of a\ngeneral withdrawal clause in a message which he had sent to the Sec-\nretary.83 SENATOR CONNALLY said that in any event the Delegation\nwould have to wait for the Secretary before it could make any final\ndecision. (COMMANDER STASSEN declared that the other questions\nwhich were related, such as amendment, should be considered also.\nCommander Stassen thought that an over-all agreement should be\nobtained among the small powers. MR. PASVOLSKY urged, however,\nthat the United States could not join the Organization unless it had\n.the power to control amendments.     MR. ARMSTRONG declared that\nhe had made a statement to that effect in the meeting of Committee\nT/2.84  Mr. Evatt had seemed surprised and as a result had asked\nfor a postponement of the subcommittee meeting in order that he\nmight devote further study to the situation.  MR. PASVOLSKY declared\nthat Mr. Evatt could not have been surprised because he had been\ninformed of this position of the United States several times. Cox-\nMANDER STASSEN declared that there was a most peculiar situation in\nthat subcommittee. This committee was composed exclusively of all\nthose States which had proposed critical amendments, plus the major\npowers.85  COMMANDER STASSEN pointed out that on the question of\nrepresentation of the permanent members of [on] the Trusteeship\nCouncil, Australia and Egypt had been opposed; but when Command-\ner Stassen had used strong tactics the measure had been carried by a\n3 Text of the President\'s message to the Secretary of State not found in\nDe-\npartment files. The delegation\'s attitude that there should be no explicit\npro-\nvision in the Charter either prohibiting the right of withdrawal or providing\nfor\nvoluntary withdrawal was first set forth in a statement by Representative\nEaton\nto Committee I/2 on May 21; for text, see Conference Series No. 71: Charter\nof\nthe United Nations: Report to the President on the Results of the San Francisco\nConference by the Chairman of the United States Delegation, the Secretary\nof\nState, June 26, 1945 (Department of State publication No. 2349), p. 47.\n8 At the June 8 meeting of Subcommittee I/2/E, in course of discussion of\na\nMexican proposal concerning the method of voting in the revision conference\nand\nthe way in which amendments adopted by it would enter into force, Mr. Arm-\nstrong stated that if there were any possibility that a revision conference\nwere\nto change the responsibility of the major powers, and if a proposal for a\nrevision\nconference which permitted such a change were to be placed in the Charter,\nit\nwould prevent ratification by the United States (US 1/2/E, Doe. 5, June 8,\n3: 30 p. m.). The Canadian delegate (Pearson) proposed that no vote be taken\non the proposal under discussion because of the statement of the United States\ndelegation and because this question was so closely tied to withdrawal; it\nwas\nagreed that the Subcommittee proceed with the discussion of withdrawal at\nits\nnext meeting.\nT Doe. 683,1/2/48, May 29, UNCIO Documents, vol. 7s p. 156.\n1229\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1291&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1291&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1291&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1291&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1291&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1291&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1291&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1290&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1292&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1290&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1292&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1291&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
