General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1374\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\n  MR. SrETNIus suggested that in view of the fact that this matter\nwas now about to come up for a vote in the Technical Committee,43\nMr. Johnson had better go down now to the Technical Committee\nand see that the matter did not come to a vote.\n  AMBASSADOR GROMYKO suggested the addition of the phrase "or\nunder regional arrangements directed against the removal [renewal?]\nof aggressive policy by enemy states".\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG asked whether the word "existing" could be\nadded. He did not believe we should write a blanket immunity for\nall regional arrangements.\n  MR. STETTINIIUS suggested that if Ambassador Gromyko had an\namendment to make he should offer it in writing. AMBASSADOR\nGROMYiiO replied that he had already suggested wording for an\namendment. He said he could not understand why there was an ob-\njection to including the reference to regional arrangements. He did\nnot feel it was wise to limit the immunity to existing treaties since\nnew treaties might be concluded that would not be any less important\nthan the arrangements under paragraph 2, Chapter XII, and that\nwould be directed particularly against the enemy states. He asked\nwhy reference should be made to one type of arrangement and not\nto another. SENATOR VANDENBERG stated the reason was that we\nknew about one type of arrangement but we did not know about the\nother type.\n  MAR. STEmNIUS stated that all the members of the group had meet-\nings which they had to attend and that it was time to reach a decision\non the question under discussion. It was agreed, he said, that there\nwould be no reference to this matter in the Charter. He suggested that\nan interpretation be worked out by a small subcommittee to which\neach of the five Delegations would appoint a member. He appointed\nMr. Dulles to act on that committee with full authority to act for the\nUnited States Delegation. He urged that agreement be reached\nupon a simple and clear-cut interpretation.\n  AMBASSADOR GROMYKO indicated that he would appoint his regular\nrepresentative on Technical Committee 111/3. AMBASSADOR Koo and\nAMBASSADOR HALIFAX agreed to the procedure suggested by Mr.\nStettinius.\n  AMBASSADOR GROMYKO asked what had been decided with respect to\nthe Rapporteur\'s report of Committee III/1.44 He said if this re-\nport was read over the radio it would cause considerable trouble, in\nview of the bad interpretation given to the discussion on the voting\n,question.\n43Doc. 1111, III/3/51, June 20.
