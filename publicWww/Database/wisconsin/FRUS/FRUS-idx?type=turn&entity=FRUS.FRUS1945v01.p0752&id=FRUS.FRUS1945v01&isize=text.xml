General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 690\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nlinson that we had discussed the matter at length and that no compro-\nmise language was possible. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said that she would\nmeet with Mr. Tomlinson at two o\'clock this afternoon. MR. Bow-\nMAN said that the picture was continually changing regarding the\nILO and the labor field in general. We would therefore lose flexi-\nbility if we recognized the ILO in the Charter.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER said that there were fifteen men from the press\noutside the door and that they were bitter at the American Delegation.\nHe thought that with the Sunday papers and special articles coming\nout we should give them background material and meet with them\neven though there was little we could say. MR. DULLES and SENATOR\nVANDENBERG agreed. SENATOR VANDENBERG said that he would be\nwilling to talk with them briefly, telling them that the Delegation\nwas completely united in its desire to find a formula, and believes it\ncan, to preserve the Act of Chapultepec without impairing measures\nto gain general security. COMMANDER STASSEN said that he saw no\nobjection to Senator Vandenberg\'s talking to the press as Chairman\nof this meeting and also in harmony with the right of any delegate\nto give background material. MR. ARMSTRONG suggested that the\npress be told other matters were also discussed.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said that she would like help in clarifying the\nfunctions of the Economic and Social Council, referring particularly\nto the Australian and Canadian proposals (pp. 20-22, Doc. 157 82).\n  MR. STINEBOWER said that a question for determination had to do\nwith the power of the Council to make recommendations to govern-\nments. He said that this did not depart from the intent of the pro-\nposal but that we should have delegation approval. SENATOR VAN-\nDENBERG believed it was dangerous to have the Council enabled to\nmake recommendations to governments for fear that the Council\nmight criticize a certain country. COMMANDER STASSEN said that the\nrecommendations to individual countries should go through the Secre-\ntariat. MR. STINEBOWER gave an example of what was intended,\nnamely that if the Council had analyzed a world inflationary trend,\ncould it send its report directly to members or must it wait for the\nGeneral Assembly? SENATOR VANDENBERG agreed that if no one\nnation were singled out, it would be appropriate to send recommenda-\ntions directly to members but he said it would still be dangerous\nsince the United States would have only one member on the Council\nwho could commit the United States to a policy. MR. STINEBOWER\nreferred to the Canadian wording (b) on page 22, wherein the Council\nis authorized "to make on its own initiative studies, reports, and\nrecommendations with respect to economic, social and other related\nmatters of international concern to the General Assembly, to mem-\n  I2Doc. 157, 11/3/5, May 9, UNCIO Documents, vol. 10, pp. 318-320.\n690\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0753&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0751&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0753&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0752&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
