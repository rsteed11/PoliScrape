Frontiers\n  In order to strengthen the forces of 'peace throughout the world,\nit is a continuing interest of the United States that the significance\nof frontiers be reduced through the development of international orga-\nnization and of freer international economic relations. In the estab-\nlishment of post-war boundaries, the objectives of the United States\ncan be best served by territorial settlements which, by doing least in-\njustice to the peoples of all the states concerned, offer the most reason-\nable prospect of general acceptance and stability. In the case of\nGermany the principles of minimum change and minimum grievance\napply fairly well to her northern, western and southern boundaries.\n  1. With Denmark.-The existing Danish-German boundary has not\nbeen challenged by the Danes, and there is no apparent reason to\npropose a change.\n  2. With the Netherlands.-No adjustment of the Netherlands land\nboundary seems desirable since it has heretofore been no source of\ndisturbance. The Netherlands Government, however, has a justified\nclaim for the relocation of the boundary in the Ems Estuary in the\nmain channel rather than along the western shore as has been main-\ntained by Germany in contravention of an established principle of\ninternational law. Unofficial Netherlands spokesmen have recently\nthreatened to claim compensation in adjacent German territory if the\nGerman army should destroy the dikes and flood the reclaimed lands\nof their country.\n   Further study is being given to the question of possible territorial\ncompensation in such an event.\n   3. With Belgiumr.-There appears to be no convincing reason why\nthe 1920 line should not be restored. The justice of the Belgian fron-\ntier as established in 1920 was attacked by the Germans, and the\npre-1914 line was restored in 1940. Despite Belgian abuse of the open\nplebiscite, the inhabitants of the disputed region had generally become\nreconciled to Belgian authority.\n   4. IWith France.-The United States Government is comnmuitted to\n the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine to France. Since there are no strong\n forces, either political or economic, working toward the creation of\n a separate state, or federation, composed of French, German, Luxem-\n bourg, Belgian and other territories within the watershed of the\n Rhine River, it would be undesirable for this Government to support\n such a proposal.\n   5. With Austria.-It is recommended that the present administra-\n tive boundary be maintained as the international frontier.
