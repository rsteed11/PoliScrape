DUNN declared that it had been the intention of the State\nDepartment and continued to be the intention to maintain the status\nquo. There was one thing, he thought, that seemed to stick in the\nmind of the Arabs and that was the- phraseology in Paragraph 8 of\nthe Trusteeship draft which left open the way for future agreement\nin the individual trusteeship arrangements. He thought that it was\nthis exception that worried them. MR. GERIG declared that it did look\nas if future arrangements might change the status quo. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN declared that the subsequent agreements were to be purely\nvoluntary, and MR. DUNN declared that all the states concerned would\nbe parties to them. COMMANDER STASSEN was of the opinion that as\na matter of strategy it might be best to assure the Arabs on the basis\nof national policy rather than on the basis of the international Charter.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLooM referred to the last sentence of the new\ndraft which referred to the wishes of the communities in question.\nCOMMANDER STASSEN declared that; this was quoted word for word\nfrom  the League Covenant. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM      wondered\nwhether these wishes might not be the majority wishes and pointed\nout that in Palestine the Arabs were in a substantial majority. He\ndeclared that according to the Treaty of 1925 54 no changes could be\nmade in the mandated status of Palestine without the consent of\nthe United States. The British White Paper 55 was illegal according\nto the terms of the mandate. The Arabs, he declared, were trying\nto obtain something for their own protection. The Jews in Palestine\nwere in the minority, and with immigration stopped the Arabs were\ntrying to keep them in the same ratio. MR. DUNN agreed that this\nwas the correct interpretation. REPRESENTATIVE BLooM declared that\nthe Arabs had no right to take this position according to the mandate\nand the treaty with the United States. He declared that he had been\nsuccessful in maintaining a friendly relationship with the Arabs and\nhad never fought with them. Mn. DUNN was of the opinion that\nthere would be no disturbance from either quarter if both sides were\nassured that there would be no change in the status. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN was of the opinion that either Mr. Dunn or Secretary Stet-\ntinius should meet with the Arabs and give them the necessary assur-\nance. MR. DUNN declared that he had met with some of the Arab\nleaders at a luncheon a few days earlier and had maintained the posi-\ntion that no change would be made in the status quo., Everybody,\nhe said, was satisfied with the existing situation but were demanding\n54 Convention between the United Sates and Great Britain relating to rights\nin Palestine, signed at London, December 3, 1924, Foreign Relations, 1924,\nvol.\nIi,-p. 212.- For text of mandate for Palestine,-.assigned to the United Kingdom\nat: Sat Remo, April 25, 1920, and approved by the Council;
