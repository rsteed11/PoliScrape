When this area should\nbe incorporated under the (Dharter, XAIR. PASVOLSKY declared, the ex-\nemption would disappear. After incorporation, this area would be-\ncome subject to the procedure implied in Chapter XII and would no\nlonger be subject to Chapter VIII, Section C, Paragraph 2.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY urged that the new wording was better than the\noriginal amendment. The phraseology "until the . . ." had been\nproposed by the British with the end in view of making certain that\nthe two individual areas would be amalgamated eventually. The\nnew wording, he declared, presented this desire positively, whereas the\noriginal amendment had been negative.\n  The argument over the situation had been initiated, MR. PASVOLSKY\ndeclared, by the French. The French were definitely worried over\nwhether their bilateral arrangements would be superseded. The new\nwording declared positively that the request of the parties to the ar-\nrangements would be required for the authority of the Organization\nto become operative.\n  MR.- PASVOLSKY expressed the opinion that Commander Stassen\'s\noriginal objection had been adequately taken care of. He himself was\nsatisfied that the matter of regional arrangements would not be re-\n-opened. SENATOR VANDENBERG urged once more that a definite\nagreement be reached on this point and MR. PASVOLSKY declared that\nsuch an agreement could be obtained but was not necessary, in his\nopinion. MR. PASVOLSKY reported that Ambassador Gromyko had\ndeclared in the Committee meeting on the previous day that he would\naccept the wording as it stood.\n  SECRETARY STETTINIUS asked whether the military representatives\nof the Delegation would care to express their opinions on this matter.\n-ADMIRAL HEPBURN declared that this was essentially a political prob-\nlem on which the military members had no definite opinion, and GEN-\nERAL EMBICK agreed with Admiral Hepburn.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG urged that there would be grave danger of\nthe question being reopened if it were to be left "hanging around"\nwithout being finally settled. SENATOR VANDENBERG urged that the\nmatter be closed promptly if the Delegation did not want the entire\nparagraph reopened.\n  MR. ARMSTRONG remarked that he had always been opposed to the\nchange of initiative implied in the substitution of the word "request"\nfor "consent". MR. ARMSTRONG remarked that if it were necessary,\nhe\nwould accept the change. MR. ARMSTRONG reported that a luncheon\nconversation with Lord Halifax the previous day had revealed that\ndespite the long discussion in the Committee session, Lord Halifax\ncould see no difference between the two words.
