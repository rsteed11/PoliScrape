Them statement that was now to be drawn up, he felt, should\nnot discourage them in any way from continuing to discuss aad to\nthink about the Proposals, nor should it play down the San Francisco\nConference. In a real sense, he said, that Conference was the people\'s\nshow. We would have to give the impression that they could come\nto it yet not invite them-a difficult thing to do.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY added that the statement should stress the im-\npracticality of delegates conferring with large numbers of represents-\ntives due to their heavy duties and schedules. REPRESENTATIVE BLOGM\nagreed that the statement should not play up the role of the people\nat the Conference at the expense of the Delegates so that the Delegates\nwould be unable to perform their primary responsibilities at San\nFrancisco.\n  The xxieeung was adjourned by the Acting Secretary at 12: 30 p. m.\n500.CC/3-2345: Tqlegram\nThe Acting Secretary of State to the Am~bassador in the United\n                       Kingdoms (Winant) 12\n                               WASHINGTON, March 23, 1945-noon.\n  2234.
