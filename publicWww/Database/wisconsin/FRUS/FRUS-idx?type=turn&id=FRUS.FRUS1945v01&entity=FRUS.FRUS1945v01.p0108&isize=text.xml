He\nagreed that the Brazilian Government was right in saying that if\nleft to a future agreement, it would lead to a contradiction.\n  Discussion of the proposals ended here and the meeting was ad-\njourned at 4:35 p.m. It was agreed that the next meeting would\nbe held on Monday, February 5, at 3: 00 p.m.\nRSC Lot 60-D 224, Box 54: ISO No. 243\nRecord of Informal Meeting With Diplomatic Representatives of\n  Certain American Republics, Held at Washington, February 5,\n  19465,3 p. m.88\n                         [Informal Notes]\n  In the absence of the Under Secretary the meeting was opened by\nthe Assistant Secretary, Mr. Rockefeller.\n  The discussion began with Chapter VIII.

PASVOLSKY stated that\nthose of Mexico again raised the question of whether the General\nAssembly should have the power of investigation. He believed that\nthat body was under the present proposals empowered to investigate.\nHe stated that the particular kind of investigation mentioned in\nparagraph 1 was solely for the purpose of determining whether or\nnot a particular situation or dispute was of such a nature that its\ncontinuance was likely to endanger peace or international security.\nHe referred again to the chapter on the Assembly in which that body\nwas given the right to study and make recommendations concerning\nany situation likely to impair the general welfare.
