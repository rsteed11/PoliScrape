General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 726\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\n    PROVISION FOR TIlE GUARANTEE OF TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY\n  Miss GinsERsIFVvE, introduced the question whether the Delegation\nwould agree to the inclusion in the Chapter on Principles of a state-\nment regarding the preservation against external aggression of the\nterritorial integrity and political independence of members. She\npointed out that some such provision would mean an enormous\namount to the small nations who want specific mention of this princi-\nple in order to feel more secure. She asked for instructions on our\nposition, in view of the New Zealand amendment 11 which was being\nheavily pushed. MR. Nonri pointed out that we were in a difficult\nspot. We interpret sovereign equality as embodying the principle\nof respect for territorial integrity. We consider the principle implicit\nso that it is difficult to answer the question why we object to spelling\nit out.\n  AlR. PASVOLSKY pointed out that the Australian amendment 12 to\nParagraph 4 was not too bad on this point in as much as it did not\ninvolve a guarantee of territorial integrity. This amendment read:\n"All members of the United Nations shall refrain in their inter-\nnational relations, from the threat or use of force-against the terri-\ntorial. integrity or political -independence of any member or state, or\nin any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United\nNations."      \'\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG was afraid that this principle in any form\nwould result in the freezing of Russian boundarAi achieved by con-\nquest. Mi. PASVOLSKY pointed out that the Soviet Uniion was actually\nopposed to the inclusion of this principle. MR. DULLES noted that\nthe Soviet Union had not yet completed its conquests.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE indicated that it was extremely difficult in the\ncomnuittee to take a firm stand against the demands of the smaller\nstates in this matter. MR. NoTTER pointed out that it might be well\nto develop a formula under which respect for external aggression\nagainst territorial integrity [would be safeguarded rather than terri-\ntorial integrity] 13 in general.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said she had a number of other items to raise\nincluding the question whether any reference should be made to\nrespect for treaties or to an obligation on members to refrain from\nintervention, and the problem of enumerating human rights in the\nCharter. THE SECRETARY asked whether decisions on the first ques-\ntion raised by Dean Gildersleeve could be held off. Mx. NOrTER\nsuggested that it could be held off a day or two. MR. SANDIFFR\npointed out that at the meeting at four o\'clock with the principal\n   Doc. 2, G/14 (f), May 2, UNCIO Documents, vol. 3, p. 486.\n 12Doc. 2, G/14(1), May 5, ibid., p. 543.\n 1\'3 Bracketed insertion on basis of draft report.\n726\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0789&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0787&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0789&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0788&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
