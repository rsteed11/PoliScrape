PREPARATORY COMMISSION\nhave got to be decided they can't spend time bothering with things that\nhave already been decided. That is the answer to our question as to\nwhether we would cry about it.\n  NOEL-BAKER: May I speak only for myself-my own personal\nopinion? Because I haven't had time to talk to Bevin. As soon as\nhe disposed of the House of Commons he went away for a week. He\nonly came back the day after I left. So I have not really had a chance\nto talk properly with him-to talk about this, so what I say now is\npersonal to me.\n  We have felt that such discussions as we have had, that on the\nSecretary-General, that the British had it after the last war for\nfourteen years, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. We\nwere followed by the French. It didn't end up very happily. We\ndon't feel very strongly now that it ought to be British or French\nand quite honestly, we want to do our best thinking in our delega-\ntion work. We -are very very short of the right people now. You\ncan't have a Russian or a Chinese and we don't find any outstanding\nsmall power people,, which leaves us with the prospect of having an\nAmerican as Secretary-General. But supposing it were an American\nand everyone agreed, would the Americans feel we were putting one\nover on them, first, by having the seat here, and then putting an Ameri-\ncan in as Secretary-General?\n  BmNEs: Somewhere in the world there should be found'a capable,\ncompetent person and if the organization is located here, my common\nsense would tell me you should not have an American, but I do not\nknow anything about it. I have not had time to make a selection.\nI would just say on general principles it does not sound reasonable\nto me and those who are charged with the duty I think should be\nable to find someone. I do not think it should be an organization of\nthe United States. It ought to be the United Nations.\n  NOEL-BAKER: Yes. That is really the difficulty about it.\n  BYRNES: When Stettinius came to see me I told him what I told\nyou about the site and I told him the same thing about the official.\n  [Here follows discussion of other matters.]\n500.CC0 (Charter)/10-2445: Circular telegram\n  The Secretary of State to Certain Diplomuatic Representative8s38\n                                   WASHINGTON, October 24, 1945.\n  Please inform FonMin that UN Charter is now in force, they follow-\ning 229 instruments of ratification having been deposited with this\n3' Addressed to the Chiefs of Mission accredited to the governments constituting\nthe membership of the United Nations.\n1461\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
