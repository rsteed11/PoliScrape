In effect\nthe British are asking us to produce munitions for them at a very high\nrate while they would turn many of their factories over to consumer\nproduction-much of it for export.\n  I told the President that the merits of the Bai i sh position were being\ndiscussed on a low level within our army and navy and that it did\nnot seem to me that this was the proper place to discuss this and, under\nany circumstances, the British contribution to the final defeat of Japan\nhad not been determined by the Combined Chiefs of S ,aft, therefore, I\ncould not see how it is possible to even discuss requirements at this\ntime.\n  I told the President that I thought, in effect, the British Government\nshould withdraw their requirements; that we, on our part, should not\nreduce the production facilities now available to the British; that lie\nand Churchill discuss this matter at Quebec and that a final decision\nbe postponed until the extent of British participation in the war\nagainst Japan was determined upon by the Combined Chiefs of Staff.\n  The President agreed with this.\n  I told him I was going to tell the British in the morning.2\n  The President commented further that, in his opinion, it would be\nvery unwise to make formal commitments tying up our industrial\n-nachinery, because he felt it quite possible that, with the defeat of\nGermany, Japan might well cave in. The primary reason would be that\nRussia might well tell the Japanese that Russia's hands are now free;\nthat Russia will not tolerate Japanese forces in Manchuria, China or\nK'orea; that, in effect, will be an ultimatum to Japan to withdraw from\nthese countries. The implications of that ultimatum will be such that\nthe President believes that Japan may throw up the sponge immedi-\nately. If this should occur, then the whole requirements picture would\nbe immediately changed. All of this is an added reason for not settling\nthe problem of British requirements at the moment.\n  Since talking to the President I have an agreement on this policy\nwith Secy. Morgenthau, Admiral Leahy, Leo Crowley, Dean Acheson,\nand General Clay who is going to communicate it to Admiral Peeves.\n  I have arranged an appointment with Ambassador Halifax at the\nBritish Embassy tomorrow morning to acquaint him of the decision\nof our government.3\n                                           H[ARRAY L.
