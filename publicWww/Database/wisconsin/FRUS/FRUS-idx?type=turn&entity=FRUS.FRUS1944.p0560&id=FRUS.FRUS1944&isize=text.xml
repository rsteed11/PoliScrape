For military reasons we should assist the Italians\nin the restoration of such power systems, their railways, motor trans-\nport, roads and other communications as enter into the war situation,\nand for a short time send engineers, technicians and industrial experts\ninto Italy to help them in their own rehabilitation.\n  \'The application to Italy of the Trading with the Enemy Acts\nshould be modified so as to enable business contacts between Italy and\nthe outside world to be resumed on the basis of exchange of goods.\n  "We all wish to speed the day when the last vestiges of Fascism in\nItaly will have been wiped out, when the last German will have left\nItalian soil, and when there will be no need of any Allied troops to\nremain-the day when free elections can be held throughout Italy,\nand when Italy can earn her proper place in the great family of free\nnations."\n  [LHYDE PARK,] September 19, 1944.\n                          Editorial Note\n  The issuance of the proposed Roosevelt-Churchill statement with\nregard to Italy was postponed at Eden\'s request. Eden\'s comments on\nthe draft statement, transmitted to the Department of State as an\nannex to a memorandum from the British Embassy at Washington\ndated September 22, 1944, were as follows:\n  "1. I much hope the President will agree to leave out paragraph\nreferring to a revision of long armistice terms. We did not include this\nin our original list of concessions because (i) to do so opens the whole\nof our position in relation to Italian surrender and would enable Italy\nto call in question all its provisions including fleet, colonies, etc.,\n(ii) W:Te could not do this without prior consultation with Russia who\nis also a party to armistice terms. To omit such consultation would\ncause great offence. Dominions who have also approved armistice\nterms would certainly expect consultation before any announcement\nwas made. It should also be remembered that long armistice terms\nhave never been made public and that military authorities have\nhitherto been unwilling to do so. Parliament would certainly press to\nsee terms if their revision is announced.\n  "2. As regards paragraph dealing with relief of hunger and sick-\nness, as we understand It UNRRA\'s help will be solely in medical side,\nsupplies for child welfare and displaced persons. Therefore it seems\nunwise to mention specifically foodstuffs and clothing which would\ncertainly make more difficult the task of our representatives at\nUNRRA in obtaining agreement. I suggest therefore that these words\n\'foodstuffs and clothing\' should be left out.\n  "3. Paragraph dealing with trading with the enemy as at present\nworded with its reference to exchange of goods would give Italy\nprivileged position over all our allies and ourselves and would under-\nmine United States-United Kingdom supply machinery. To avoid\nthis danger I suggest that in this paragraph we should therefore omit\nlast words: \'on basis of exchange of goods\'."\n496\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0014.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0014.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0560&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0560&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0560&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0560&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0560&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0560&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0560&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0014.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0015&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0545&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0559&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0561&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0014.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0015&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0545&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0559&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0561&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0560&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
