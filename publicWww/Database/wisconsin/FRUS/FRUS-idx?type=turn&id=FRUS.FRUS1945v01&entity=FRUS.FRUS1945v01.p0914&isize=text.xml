We\nhad\nnot embarrassed them on questions such as freedom of information.\nMR. PASVOLSKY pointed out, however, that it was not only the other\nfour powers which were in opposition, to which COMMANDER STASSEN\nreplied that agreement among the Big Five was essential. DEAN\nGILDERSLEEVE voiced the opinion that even with Big Five agreement\nit would still be impossible to alter the decision of the Committee\nwhich seemed very strongly to favor the original wording. DEAN\nGILDERSLEEVE, in reply to a question from Mr. Pasvolsky, declared\nthat the Chinese had voiced no opinion. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE repeated\nthat Mr. Fraser had seemed to agree on the adoption of "through\ninternational collaboration." The latter had made clear that New\nZealand would not want to foster interference in the domestic affairs\nof the member states but this problem was adequately covered, he\nthought, by the new wording adopted in Chapter II.\n  MR. HACKWORT proposed that a specific condition be established\nin the clause on full employment making its provisions subject to the\nprovision of the "domestic jurisdiction" clause in Chapter II.\nMR.\nDULLES opposed this on the grounds that it would be dangerous be-\ncause all provisions of the Charter are subject to the exception estab-\nlished in the "domestic jurisdiction" clause. To make a specific\nreference to this clause in connection with any single provision in the\ndocument would be to weaken the entire document. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN expressed the opinion that it did not make sense to establish\nan exception for matters of domestic jurisdiction and to support else-\nwhere in the Charter a provision making possible interference in\ndomestic affairs. DEAN GILDERSLEEVE remarked that none of the\nrepresentatives seemed to support interference by the Organization in\nthe domestic affairs of any of the member states.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked why Mr. Hackworth\'s suggestion that\nspecific reference be made to the "domestic jurisdiction" clause\ncould\nnot be adopted. MR. DULLES replied that such a reference would\nweaken the entire document and asked why it was necessary to make\nit specifically applicable in this instance. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM\nindicated that it was possible that the safeguards incorporated in\nChapter II might not be interpreted strongly enough as applying\nuniversally throughout the document, with the exception of course of\nSection B, Chapter VIII. In view of the fact that doubts might arise\non this question REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM thought that its application\nin this connection might be made explicit. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM\nsaid he was not a lawyer.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM proposed that Dean Gildersleeve try every\npossible means to push through a wording that would be acceptable\nto the U.S. Delegation. MR. HACKWORTH suggested that if it were\nimpossible to achieve an acceptable wording in the clause itself then at\n852\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0914&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0914&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0914&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0914&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0914&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0914&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0914&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0913&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0915&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0913&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0915&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0914&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
