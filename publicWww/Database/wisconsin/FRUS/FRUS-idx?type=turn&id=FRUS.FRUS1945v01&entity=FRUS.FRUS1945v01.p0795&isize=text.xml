He expressed the opinion\nthat in addition to the drafts proposed and-the statement made by\nthe Secretary it would be helpful to have an additional statement\nregarding- the value of the inter-American system for the future of\nAmerica.\n  SENAWR VANDENBERG stated that unfortunately he must leave the\nmeeting but before doing so he wanted to say on behalf of the United\nStates that he warmly welcomed the sentiments expressed by Dr.\nPadilla and that in some future press conference it mnight be possible\nto say something along the line of what he had said.\n  (At this point Senator Vandenberg left the meeting.)\n  AMBASSADOR BELT again returned to the question of what the Latin\nAmerican delegates should say when voting on Chapter VIII, Sec-\ntion C, indicating that he felt that he could not give the appearance\nof voting to destroy the inter-American system. THE SECRETARY\ninquired how his vote would destroy the inter-American system. THE\nAMBASSADOR replied that the two drafts gave no recognition to the\ninter-American system and the statement by the Secretary would not\nbe known when the vote was taken.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN held that the new paragraph clearly gave us\nthe right to negotiate a treaty implementing the Act of Chapultepec\nand that was all that was necessary at this point. Moreover, voting\non Section C of Chapter VIII was an individual matter and if any\ndelegate had made public commitments which would prevent his\nvoting in its favor that was his concern. AMBASSADOR: BELT replied\nthat it was not an individual matter since the Latin American group\nhad taken a definite position and must justify an apparent retreat\nfrom it. COMMANDER STASSEN reaffirmed his opinion that the new\nparagraph offered the basis upon which the necessary action to imple-\nment the Act of Chapultepec could be taken and that perhaps some-\nthing along that line could be said by the Secretary at some future\npress conference.\n  THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF VENEZUELA remarked that the new para-\ngraph was included in Sections A and B of Chapter VIII and not\nin Section C and that consequently the latter Section read by itself\nmight convey the wrong impression.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY gave assurances that the United States Dele-\ngation fully recognized the difficulties confronting their Latin Ameri-\ncan colleagues and that if the Delegation had the power to do so it\nwould remove those difficulties. However, they should bear in mind\nthat a great number of other nations were involved and that no one\nof them could get everything it desired.
