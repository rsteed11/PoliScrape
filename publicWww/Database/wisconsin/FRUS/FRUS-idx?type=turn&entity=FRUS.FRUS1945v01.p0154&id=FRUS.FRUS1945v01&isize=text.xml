Obviously, the Provisional Government of France, as every other\nGovernment participating in that Conference, will be free to present\ncomments and proposals for consideration at the Conference. It is\nnot, however, believed that the Governments sponsoring the Confer-\nence could accept the conditions of the Provisional Government that\nthe invitations specify that its proposed amendments be accepted "as\na basis for discussion" at San Francisco. To do so would be contrary\nto the agreements reached at the Crimea Conference, subsequently\napproved by the Chinese Government, that the Dumbarton Oaks pro-\nposals-as supplemented by the text of the provisions on the voting\nprocedure in the Security Council-should serve as the basis for dis-\ncussion at the San Francisco Conference.\n  3. It is the view of this Government in jointly sponsoring the\nSan Francisco Conference-as we assume that it is the view of the\nBritish, Soviet and Chinese Governments-that, prior to the issuance\nof the invitations, there must be mutual agreement among the sponsor-\ning governments upon the proposals that are to serve as the basis for\ndiscussion at the San Francisco Conference. Such agreement in the\nform of the Dumbarton Oaks proposals as supplemented at the Crimea\nConference now exists on the part of the Governments of the United\nStates, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China.\n  4. It would appear to be clear from the nature of the message from\nthe Provisional Government of France that the latter is, in fact, not\nwilling to become one of the sponsors of the invitations to the San\nFrancisco Conference without a change in the proposals which are to\nserve as a basis for the San Francisco Conference. While this Gov-\nernment under normal circumstances would be willing to continue\nconsultations with the French for the purpose of obtaining the agree-\nment of the Provisional Government, such consultation might well\nprove lengthy and protracted, with the result that the issuance of\ninvitations to the Conference would be greatly delayed and the date\nthereof indefinitely postponed.\n  5. In the light of the position of the Provisional Government of\nthe French Republic as thus set forth in its communication, it appears\nto the Government of the United States that the four sponsoring pow-\ners must reluctantly accept the decision of the Provisional Govern-\nment and proceed with the issuance of the invitations on March 1,\n12 o\'clock noon, Washington time, in the name of the Governments of\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the\nRepublic of China as previously proposed (my 752, February 23,\nmidnight 69).\n  6. This Government is further of the opinion that at the time the\ntext of the invitations to the San Francisco Conference is made public\nthe position of the Provisional Government of France regarding the\nforegoing matters should be fully and sympathetically explained by\nthis Government to the press.\n  7. It should be added that the Provisional Government of France\nstated in its communication to this Government that as regards the\nestablishment of a "trusteeship" system, the Provisional Government\n-is not in a position to pronounce itself -on this question before receiving\n\'&#176; Not printed; it repeated text of instruction in telegram 1407, February\n23,\nmidnight, to London, p. 87.\n92\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0154&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0154&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0154&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0154&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0154&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0154&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0154&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0153&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0155&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0153&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0155&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0154&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
