General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 360\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1.9 4 5, X VOLUME I\n  In connection with both the possibility of a bill of rights and the\nduration of the Conference Dr. Padilla expressed the view that we\nmight well find ourselves confronted by a cleavage of the East and\nthe West. He said that that was one of the reasons we ought to con-\ncentrate on a charter of basic obligations which could be accepted\nby both the East and the West.\n  Dr. Padilla also asked me what I thought the French attitude\nwould be. He said that he was rather disturbed by the statements\nwhich have been made by Bidault and other members of the French\nGovernment. What interested him most was whether or not France\nreally intended to operate outside the organization in matters of\nsecurity. I said that it is not as yet clear what general attitude the\nFrench were going to assume, but it was apparent that they would\nattempt to argue in favor of special arrangements. In that case, I\nsaid that it would be the same question that confronted us in our\nInter-American discussions. Dr. Padilla said that as far as Mexico\nwas concerned, it was perfectly clear that in matters of security the\nworld organization must hold a controlling position, because other-\nwise the whole question of world peace and security would be com-\npletely undermined.\n  On the question of the two Soviet Republics, Dr. Padilla expressed\nthe view that their addition to membership might not be a serious\nmatter from the point of view of Russia's position in the voting by\nthe Assembly, but that there was an important question of principle\ninvolved, regarding the qualification for membership in the organ-\nization. He suggested that even without the two representatives\nSoviet Russia might have as many as eight votes which would be\nfavorable to her. I did not press Dr. Padilla for his views as to\nwhat he would do if the Soviet delegation were to raise the question\nof the two Republics, and he did not volunteer any statement on that\nsubject.\nRSC Lot 60-D 224, Box 96: U.S. Cr.
