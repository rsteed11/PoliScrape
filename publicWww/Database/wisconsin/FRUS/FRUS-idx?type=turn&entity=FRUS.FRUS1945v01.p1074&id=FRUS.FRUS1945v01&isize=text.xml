He said that there, was a growing feeling that\nthe Big Five were not showing the proper leadership in the Con-\nference. As a result, the situation appeared to be drifting away\nLast and they would have to act quickly and decisively to get things\nback into their own hands. This meant taking strong leadership in\nbringing the Conference to as rapid and successful a conclusion as\npossible.\n  The Secretary said that there was much talk to the effect that if\nthe Big Five could not quickly agree among themselves at this Con-\nference, then how could the proposed international organization-\ndepending as it did upon their continuing unanimity-hope to be\nsuccessful. He said that he himself was very much disturbed by the\nsituation and for that reason thought that an informal talk regarding\nthe problems now facing the Conference and the Big Five might be\nhelpful to both Delegations.\n  Accordingly, the Secretary said that he wanted Mr. Pasvolsky to\nreview briefly for them the major issues upon which decisions of the\nBig Five were necessary.\n               MAJOR ISSUIES REQUIRING DECISIONS\n  Mr. Pasvolsky said that the major issues yet remaining before the\nConference appeared to be as follows:\n  1.
