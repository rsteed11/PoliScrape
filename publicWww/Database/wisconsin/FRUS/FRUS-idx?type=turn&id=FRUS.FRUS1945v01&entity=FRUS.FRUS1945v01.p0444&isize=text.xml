General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 382\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1 9 4 5, VOLUME I\nand that he wished to know whether there was any justification to be-\nlieve that the three nations would be able to have their agreement car-\nried into effect.\n  THE SECRETARY said he thought he had made clear the position of\nthe U.S. Government; namely, that he would live up to the agreement.\nHe added that since Mr. Molotov had requested his personal opinion,\nhe felt that the attitude of the Conference could not help but be affected\nby the failure of the three nations to reach an agreement on the Polish\nquestion. He added that this failure had cast doubt on the unity and\ncollaboration between the three powers which was the corner stone\nof the Dumbarton Oaks proposals and that as a friend he must state\nthis view frankly to Mr. Molotov. He said that he was confident that\nif we could agree on the Polish question that the Conference would in\nall probability be willing to accept the Soviet proposal.\n  MR. MOLoTov replied that he felt that a failure to carry out the\nCrimea agreement on the admission of White Russia and the Ukraine\ncould only worsen the situation; that to add failure on this point to our\ninability to carry out the decision on Poland would be an even more\nserious indication of disagreement between us.

MOLOTov remarked that the agreement had been published to\nwhich TiH SECRETARY replied that that was after Mexico City.\n  MR. MoLoTov then said that he had some indications that the Domin-\nions were prepared to support this proposal.\n  THE SECRETARY again reported to Mr. Molotov his impression of the\neffect of failure to reach the agreement on Poland would have at the\nConference.86 He said that he felt if we could only agree here on\nthe plan of consultation with Polish leaders from within and without\nPoland and that the Commission could go back to Moscow to continue\nits work, the effect would be most beneficial.
