General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1101\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS OON'E'RENCE1\nserving the principle of the unanimity of the permanent members.\nUpon MR. STETrrNius' remarking that he liked the proposal made at\nthe previous meeting of the five by Dr. Koo and requesting the latter\nto repeat it, DR. Koo said that it was in brief that if a definite period\nfor the calling of the Conference were to be fixed the majority should\nbe two-thirds, but if no period were set then there should be a three-\nfourths majority.\n  In reply to Mr. Stettinius' request for his opinion on this, MR. ARm-w\nSTRONG said that he had no comments on the merits of Dr. Koo's pro-\nposal but that he had no doubt that the preference of the Committee's\nmembership would be for the setting of a specific date with provision\nthat the Conference should be called by a smaller majority. He em-\nphasized that the problem confronting the Five at this moment was:\nHow would they vote this afternoon? Upon being asked by Mr. Stet-\ntinius for his recommendation, MR. ARMSTRONG said that he favored\nfixing a date between 7 and 10 years after the establishment of the\nOrganization and allowing the Conference to be called by a two-\nthirds vote; we might propose the former but should not propose the\nlatter, merely going along if it was proposed by someone else.\n  LoRD HALIFAX asked if Mr. Armstrong would accept this rather\nthan stand by the words in the draft under consideration. MR. Asur-\nSTRONG said that he would because the alternative appeared to be the\nacceptance of Evatt's proposal that a specific date be set for the Con-\nference, with the clear implication that the present Organization is to\nbe transitory. There ensued a discussion between LoRD HALIFAX and\nMR. ARMSTRONG, in which the former said he could not see why Mr.\nArmstrong's proposal for a 7 to 10 year period, which to him seemed\nmore restrictive than his own, would satisfy the Committee.\n  M. PAuL-BocouR remarked that he did not understand precisely\nthe relationship between this provision for a conference and the gen-\neral right to introduce amendments; if amendments can be introduced\nat any time, why was it necessary to make provision for a conference\nas well? MR. PASVOLSKY explained that the new paragraph does not\naffect the present text on amendments, which will remain, and that\nits introduction was for the purpose of making the amendment pro-\ncedure more acceptable to the small powers.\n  MR. ST'IINruS, in order to clarify the discussion, suggested that\nthe Five agree to meet the Committee's desire to the extent of pro-\nviding for a two-thirds vote instead of three-fourths and then point\nout to the Colmmittee that all other votes of the Assembly on substan-\ntive matters are by two-thirds majority and we should not restrict it\nmore. In this case we would stand on the rest of the draft on [in] the\ndiscussion. After Lous HAuAx had indicmted his acceptance of this\nproposal, there ensued some discussion in the course of which: M&amp;\n1101\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1163&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1163&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1163&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1163&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1163&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1163&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1163&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1162&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1164&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1162&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1164&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1163&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
