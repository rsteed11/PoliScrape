PASVOLSKY asked whether it was thought that the Russians\nwould accept the language he had proposed and SENATOR VANDENIERG\nreplied in'the negative, saying that wo one s maed to want to accept\nthis language. MR. Gm2I- reported that, -as he recalled the situation,\nthe phraseology proposed by Mr. Paavolsky had been drafted at the\nend of the four o'clock meeting on the previous day.' UIowever, it\nhad not been considered at the 8: 30 meeting because Mr. Evatt had\nintroduced his new phraseology. MR. PAsvo.TKY thought that the\nshort form which he had proposed was the only acceptable solution.\nMr. Pasvolsky did not think that Mr. Evatt's suggestion was ade-\nquate and declared that it would spoil the whole article. MR.\nPAsvO6LsK  pointed out that the Coordination Committee was ilaking\na complte- article out'of this paragraph. MR. DuuLLs thought\nthat, if agreement were reached on this wording, the Coordina-\ntion Committee could boil it down to the wording proposed\nby Mr. Pasvolsky. He pointed out that the matter was still in a\nnegotiating stage and he did not think there was any reason to ob-\nject at that time to the language proposed by Mr. Evatt. MR. PAS-\nVOLSKY declared that if Mr. Evatt had the idea that anything beyond\nthe terms of the Charter could possibly be involved in this paragraph,\nhe had best forget it. MR. HAGCWORTH declared that he would favor\noutvoting Mr. Evatt on the matter but Mr. Dulles replied that there\nwas no reason to do this because the matter was still in the negotiating\nstage. CO   DER STASSEN thought that the important point was\nthat Mr. Evatt had withdrawn from his previous position but MR.\nPAsvoxzicY pointed out that if Mr. Evatt were to present his language\nto the Steering Committee he would, in effect, be committed to it.\nMR. DOLEzs reiterated that all the parties to the discussion were in a\nnegotiating position. There were, he declared, two states standing on\nantithetical positions. The important matter was to get these two\nopposing parties to withdraw from their insistence on a fixed phrase-\nology. Mr. Evatt, he declared, had already indicated his willingness\nto comtpromise, by the mere fact of presenting a new wording. SECRT-\nTARY STrmTINIUs declared that he thought Mr. Pasvolsky was correct\nbut he urged that the matter would have to be referred to the technical\ncommittee for negotiation. MR. b-uNN suggested that no specific lan-\nguage be used by the Secretary asking the Committee to postpone its\nconsideration of the matter. He thought that the requirement could\nbe met by speaking to the Chairman of the Committee and asking him\nnot to call a vote.\n'The Subcommittee met at noun, 4: 30 p. m., and 8: 30 p. ha., June 17.\n1343\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1405&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1405&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1405&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1405&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1405&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1405&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1405&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1404&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1406&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1404&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1406&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1405&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
