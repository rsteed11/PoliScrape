General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 451\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nStassen replied that he would have no objection, but- that arrange-\nments with respect to his other assignments would have to be made.\n  Senator Connally inquired if Genera] Embick concurred in the ac-\nceptance of the proposed trusteeship draft. General Embick replied\naffirmatively and added that the Army and Navy feel that there are\ntwo essential bases for our security-hemispheric solidarity and con-\ntrol of the necessary islands in the Pacific.\n  Senator Vandenberg inquired of General Embick whether he was\naware that we are engaged in creating a world organization and won-\ndered whether this might be the source of trouble over this document.\n  General Embick responded that he had believed in the League of\nNations and in world order, but that he believes there was more chance\nfor the League of Nations to endure than for a new world organization\nto endure.\n  General Embick stated that there is too much chaos in the world of\ntoday. He felt, however, that the people in America would give the\nnew world organization full support, but the American people must\nrecognize the extent of the chaos in the world and the lack of common\nstandards of value. Therefore, the American people must keep a\nsharp lookout for United States interests. In 1918, he stated, the\nmilitary people did all they could to keep the Pacific islands from\nbeing mandated to Japan, and later to prevent their fortification. He\npointed out that the American military leaders had made plans for de,-\nfense of the Philippines which they knew were hopeless. He stated\nthat they had told the President when Japan took those islands that all\nthe military could do at Corregidor would be to continue to fly the\nAmerican Flag as a matter of national prestige. If the United States\nis to be adequately protected, he said, we must have an entire chain of\nisland bases.\n  Admiral Willson called attention to the fact that the trusteeship\nplan as now formulated falls under both the, Security Council and\nthe General Assembly. Therefore, he felt that there might be an\norganizational problem in that the draft proposal would actually need\nto be considered by two committees of the Conference. Senator Con-\nnally pointed out that the classification of territories was based on\nislands that we had need of for strategic purposes and those which\nwere not needed for such purposes.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky explained that consideration had been given to the\nquestion of Conference organization during the afternoon, and that\na statement had been made to the effect that in some instances there\nwould be unavoidable overlapping and that this would be taken care of.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky's recommendation that the draft proposal incorporat-\ning the three changes suggested by the Secretaries of War and Navy\nbe adopted as the negotiating document was approved.\n451\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
