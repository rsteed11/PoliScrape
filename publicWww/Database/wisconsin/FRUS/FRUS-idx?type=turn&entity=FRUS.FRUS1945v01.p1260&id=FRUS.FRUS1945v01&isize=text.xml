THE SECRETARY remarked to Mr. Rocke-\nfeller that Ambassador Velloso had voted against resubmitting the\nquestion to the technical committee after he had committed himself\nto support the motion. MR. PASVOLSKY remarked that there were\nquite a few of the Latin American states which had voted against\nthe U.S. position and THE SECRETARY thought it would be necessary\nfor him to speak to them.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER explained that in view of the prohibition against\nmaking clear to the smaller powers the issues which were under con-\nsideration, there had been a great deal of uncertainty among the\nLatin American states. As a result they had fallen prey to Mr.\nEvatt\'s argument that any attempt to have the Steering Committee\nreverse the decisions of the lesser bodies was an evidence of power\ntactics.54 THE SECRETARY thought that this situation had been clar-\nified by the decisions of the Executive Committee several days pre-\nviously providing that the Steering Committee had power only to\nmake recommendations to the technical committees. MR. ROCKE-\nFELLER declared that he was somewhat concerned over Mr. Velloso\'s\naction and he hoped that everything would move smoothly from that\ntime on.\n  THE SECRETARY declared that there was to be a meeting of the\nSteering Committee that afternoon m for the purpose of considering\nthe decisions of the Executive Committee.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY returned to the question of the General Assembly.\nHe thought that, inasmuch as this matter had been considered by two\ncommittees, Committee III/1 and Committee II/2, and since the Com-\nmittee dealing with the Security Council had voted down the pro-\npo\'sal that the General\'Assembly be permitted to review the reports\nof the Security Council, whereas Committee\' 11/2 dealing with the\nGeneral Assembly had passed the motion,56 the matter should be re-\nferred to a joint subcommittee of the two technical committees. MR.\n   Doe. 806, EX/17, June 6, UNCIO Documents, vol. 5, p. 461.\n   Doe. 893, ST/14, June 9, ibid., p. 232.\n   5 Committee III/1, at a meeting of May 23. 8: 45 p. m.. adopted the following\ntext as a final sentence to paragraph 1, sec. B, chapter VI: "The Security\nCoiin-\ncii shall submit annual, and if necessary, special reports to the General\nAssembly\nfor its consideration." (Doe. ,555, III/1/27, May 24, ibid., vol. 11,\np. 377). At\na meeting of Committee 11/2, May 30. 8: 33 p. m.. the report of Subcommittee\nB\non the redraft of paragraph 8, section B, chapter V was adopted (Doc. 707,\n11/2/36, May 31. ibid., vol. 9. p. 115). At a meeting of the Executive Comtrnt-\ntee, June 8, 10: 30 a. m., the Secretary General stated that action by Committee\n111/3 at a meeting of May 15, 3: 40 p. m., in rejecting a New Zealand amendment\n(Doe. 2, G/14 (f), ibid., vol,3. p. 488) requiring the concurring vote of\nthe Gen-\neral Assembly in decisions of the Security Council involving the application\nof\nforce. was inconsistent. in principle at least, with the action taken by\nCommiiit-\ntee II/2 (Doe. 355, III/3/17, May 17, ibid., vol. 12, p. 326).\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1260&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1260&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1260&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1260&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1260&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1260&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1260&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1259&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1261&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1259&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1261&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1260&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
