NOTTER said the question then arose as to what vote was neces-\nsary to determine procedural matters. It was clear only that matters\nunder Section D, Chapter VI would be procedural. On these a vote\nof any seven would be satisfactory. SENATOR VANDENBERG asked how\nit was possible to find out what came within the procedural category.\nMR. NoT=ER replied we must settle the matter here. SENATOR CON-\nNALLY asked why investigation was not a procedural matter. MR.\nDULLEs replied that the decision to go ahead on an investigation was\na very -important substantive matter.\n  THE SECRETARY suggested that we should await, our decision until\nwe had the interpretation of the Subcommittee of Five. MR. PASVOL-\nSKY reported that the other four powers were unanimous that para-\ngraph 1 dealt with substantive matters and that the procedural vote\ndid not apply there. The British, he said, had made it clear that Sir\nAlexander Cadogan was out of line on this matter.48 It was interest-\ning that the Chinese were proving the most vociferous on behalf of\nthe veto on investigations as a result of their experience with the\nLytton Commission.49 SENATOR CONNALLY indicated that we were in\na very -serious situation on this whole question. MR. PASVOLSKY re-\nmarked that the Big Five had agreed to isolate the questions that\nmight be considered to fall under the procedural vote. There were\nnine decisions of the Council outside of Chapter VIII which had to\nbe examined from this point of view, two of which had already been\nexamined. It had been agreed that the convocation of the Assembly\nshould be by procedural vote and that the constitutional convention\nshould be called by a procedural vote as already provided. Other de-\ncisions to be discussed dealt with the election of judges, the election of\nthe Secretarv-General, the admission of new members, the suspension\nof the rights of membership, expulsion, request by the Council for the\nhelp of the Assembly, and trusteeship matters.\n  THE SECRETARY felt that this question must be brought to a close\nas soon as possible since he would have to spend a day very soon in\nWashington and he would like to feel that this voting question was\nwell along. MIR. DUNN stated that the Subcommittee was now draw-\ning up a list of questions which we would then have before us. SEN-\nATOR CONNALLY agreed that the matter should be expedited, but he\n  48 The United States delegation was informed by Senator Connally at its\nexecu-\ntive session, May 20, noon, of Sir Alexander Cadogan\'s interpretation of\nthe\nformula; see p. 822.\n49 The Earl of Lytton, Fdward Robert Bulwer, British member and chairman.\nLeague of Nations Commission of Inquiry concerning Manchuria.
