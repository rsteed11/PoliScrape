SENATOR CONNALLY indicated that paragraph 3 could\nbe redrafted to make it perfectly clear that a state can present its\ncase and be heard. MP. STASSEN agreed that paragraph 3 could be\ngreatly clarified. MR. PASVOLSKY suggested that the sentence might\nvery well begin: "No individual member of the Council can alone\nprevent . . ." He wondered whether we could not agree on this\nformula now.\n  AmBASSADOR GROMYKo replied that it would be difficult, since he\ntdid not understand the meaning of the first lines in paragraph 3.\n  AMBASSADOR HALIFAX indicated that he had been inpressed by, Mr.\nDulles\' argument and he wondered whether paragraph -3 might not\nbe revised to bring in the point made by Mr. Dulles. It-might read:\n"Since any state may bring any dispute to the attention of the Secu-\nrity Council, it follows that no individual member can alohe prevent\n:a consideration and discussion by the Council of a dispute or situation\nbrought to its attention." He thought something along -this line\nwould serve our purpose.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY thought the meaning of paragraph 3 was clear as\nit stood. He questioned whether it was necessary to take the matter\nup with the Subcommittee again and thought agreement could be\nTeached upon a draft now.\n  SIR ALEXANDER CADOGAN suggested that the Subcommittee consider\nmaking the draft clearer. MR. PASVOLSKY commented that the simple\nstatement could be made that: "It is our uAderstanding of the voting\nformula that no individual state can prevent a matter from being\nbrought before the Security Council and that no individual state can\nprevent consideration and discussion of that matter."\n  MR. STEqMrINrus suggested that the Subcommittee could meet on\nthis problem and that this group could reconvene during the after-\nnoon or evening.\n  MR. SoBouiv asked what answer was going to be given to question\n19. SIR ALEXANDER CADOGAN replied that this question could wait\nsince it was not so urgent.\n,MR. PASVOLSKY thought that the two questions should be separated.\nOn the one hand, we needed to clarify our minds as to the)functioxs\nto be specified in the Charter that would require a proceduial vote.\nThere would still, however, be question 19 to which an answer would\nhave to be given. AMBASSADOR GROMMYKo asked when an answer would\nbe forthcoming to this question. SIR ALEXANDFR CADOGAN did not\nthink the two questions were bound together. AMBASSADOR GROMYKO\nasled when it would be-possible to reach agreement on question 19.\n  MR. ,PsVOLSKY replied that the American Delegation had not- yet\nconsidered this pro oblem and thathe felt it was not as serious a question\nas it would be if it was not possible to specify in the Charter the ques-\ntions reqviring a procedural Vote.
