Press conference. The full delegation held a large and success-\nful press conference this morning5 at which I gave out three state-\nments, one describing the joint amendments submitted to the confer-\nence by the four sponsoring powers, the second quoting the amend-\nments submitted by the United States alone, and the third dealing\nwith the arrest of the Polish underground leaders.6 The conference\nwent off smoothly and the general impression seems to have been\ngood on all counts.\n  2. Meeting with consultants.7 I also attended this morning a meet-\ning of the consultants representing the various national organizations\nand took up with them the amendments submitted last night. There\nwas on the whole general satisfaction with the position which the\ndelegation had taken. Only two groups expressed some dissatisfac-\ntion, the C.I.O., which wished representation on the economic com-\nmission to be by representatives of organizations rather than by ex-\nperts as provided in the present draft, and the educational groups\nwhich felt there should have been a separate commission on education.\n  3. Reconciliation of differences on amendments. The staff of the\nUnited States delegation is actively engaged in examining the amend-\nments submitted by the various countries. Particular attention will\nbe given to attempts to reconcile the remaining differences among the\nfour sponsoring powers to whose consultations France will henceforth\nbe added. The chiefs of these five delegations will meet Monday\nafternoon in my office for this purpose. I am very hopeful that we\nwill reach agreement early next week on the two issues still remain-\ning open among the sponsoring powers. As a matter of fact we\nmissed agreement last night only by the narrowest margin.8 Agree-\nment in principle had in fact been reached on a substitute provision\nthe language of which has already been transmitted to you for that\nadvanced by Senator Vandenberg originally relating to the review\nof treaties. The Senator believes that the new draft includes not\nonly everything he had in mind but infinitely more. We were also\nextremely close to agreement on the paragraph on regional arrange-\nments which has now been submitted as a separate United States\namendment but at the last moment Molotov insisted that he would\nhave to consult the French before giving definite assent.\n  6May 5.\n  6   statements by the Secretary of State, see Department of State Bulletin,\nMay 6, 1945, pp. 850 and 855-857;
