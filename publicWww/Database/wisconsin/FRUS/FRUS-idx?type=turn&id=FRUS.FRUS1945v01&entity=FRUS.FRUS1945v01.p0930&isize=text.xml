SENATOR CONNALLY pointed out that we had\nno assurance that the French would accept the proposed revision, but\nMR. PASVOLSEY pointed out that the French had proposed it them-\nselves a few days previously and that the British also seemed to favor\nthis wording. MR. PAsvoLsKY remarked, however, that Senator Van-\ndenberg\'s Committee, would be forced to remain in session, and the\nSENATOR declared that this was not too important. However, he\nthought that it would be a healthy step if one committee did finish\nits work. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM declared that his committee would\nprobably finish shortly, and SENATOR VANDENBERG remarked that he\nmeant an important committee!\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG declared that he could not see any point in\nsending Mr. Pasvolsky back without power to negotiate. He should\nbe authorized to stand pat on the existing wording, and if necessary\ngive up "request". MR. NovrER declared that France had a veto now,\nand as a result had no less initiative than under the new wording. SEN-\nATOR CONNALLY announced that the Delegation unanimously agreed\nthat Mr. Pasvolsky should return to the Committee to do the best he\ncould. If he could not get assurance for the existing wording, he\nshould be empowered to try to get Five Power agreement on a substi-\ntute. SENATOR VANDENBERG said that the decision was only semi-\nunanimous and asked that the motion be repeated. When a vote was\nfinally taken the decision was upheld 4 to 1 with SENATOR VANDENBERG\ndissenting on the grounds that the issue was not important enough to\nbe taken to the Heads of the Delegations.\n              PROPOSAL BY URUGUAY ON CHAPTER XI\n  MR. SANDIFER presented document U.S. Gen. 147 86 to the Delega-\ntion. The question before the Delegation was whether, under the\nrules of procedure setting May 4 as the deadline for amendments, a\nUruguayan amendment to Chapter XI 87 should be accepted. This\namendment, he declared, would be submitted to Committee I/2. MR.\nSANDIFER did not think there could be any objection to accepting the\nUruguayan amendment. MR. PASVOLSKY proposed that we should per-\nmit introduction of the amendment, but at the same time inform the\nUruguayan Representative that the United States would oppose the\nsubstance of the amendment. SENATOR CONNALLY asked why there\nshould be a rule on this question of introducing amendments if it were\nnot upheld, and MR. SANDIFER declared that there had been so many\nexceptions already that the Uruguayan proposal could be excluded\n\'U.S. Gen. 147, not printed (recommendations on basic issues, Committee\nIII/3, agreements for the provision of forces, facilities, and assistance).\n8 Text of proposed Uruguayan amendment, not printed.
