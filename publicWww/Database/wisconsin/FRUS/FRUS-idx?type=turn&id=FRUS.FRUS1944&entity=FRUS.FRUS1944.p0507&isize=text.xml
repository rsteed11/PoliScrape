Landings were preceded by heavy naval bombardment and\nair strafing attacks.\n  a. The Hollandia Task Force made landings in the Humboldt Bay\nand Tanahmerah Bay areas respectively and formed a pincers move-\nment in attacking the three airstrips. Only slight enemy resistance was\nencountered and by 1 May control of the area had been definitely\nestablished.\n  b. The Aitape Task Force established landings against practically\nno opposition and the airdrome was reported operational by 25 April.\n  c. The element of surprise played an important part in the success\nof both operations resulting in an estimated 54,000 troops to the east-\nward being cut off.\n  18. A U.S. task force, supported by air and naval forces, made\nunopposed landings on Wakde Island and near Arara on 17 May 1944.\nAll enemy resistance on Wakde was overcome by 18 May. The\nArara perimeter was extended between the Tementoe River and the\nTor River on 17 May with increasing enemy resistance west of the Tor\nRiver. Strong enemy attacks failed to penetrate the perimeter and\nwere repulsed. The task force perimeter was extended and by 3 July\nincluded the Maffin airdrome. Casualties suffered by the Japanese are\n3,650 killed and 70 prisoners. Active patrolling is continuing.\n  19. On 27 May 1944 one U.S. infantry division, with the support of\nair and naval forces, made landings in the Biak Island areas and\nencountered little opposition initially. Enemy strength developed on\n5 June and the Mokmer airstrip was crossed on 7 June under artillery,\nmortar and machine gun fire. Artillery fire prevented work on the\nMokmer airdrome until 11 June and the enemy launched several un-\nsuccessful counterattacks in an effort to regain the field. Boroke,\nSorido and Mokmer dromes were entirely cleared of enemy artillery\nand small arms fire by 22 June. General patrolling and mopping up\noperations continue.\n  20. One U.S. regimental combat team, closely supported by air and\nnaval forces, landed unopposed near the Karniri drome on Noemfoor\nIsland on 2 July 1944. On 3 July and 4 July three U.S. parachute\nbattalions were dropped on the Kamiri strip, assisting the infantry.\nBy 6 July enemy resistance had been overcome and the Kamiri,\nKoransoren and Namber dromes were firmly held.\n  21. A U.S. infantry task force made an unopposed landing near\nCape Opmarai in the Cape Sansapor area on 30 July 1944. No opposi-\ntion other than patrol skirmishes has been encountered and active\npatrolling continues. Japanese dead for the period 30 July to 10 August\nnumbered 92.\n  22. Air operations conducted in the Southwest Pacific Area have\nbeen especially effective in neutralizing Japanese forces and enabling\n445\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0013.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0013.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0507&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0507&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0507&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0507&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0507&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0507&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0507&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0013.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0012&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0014&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0445&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0506&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0508&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0013.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0012&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0014&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0445&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0506&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0508&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0507&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
