Ambassador\nGromyko however, had urged that the Charter be signed according\nto the order in which the participating nations had signed the United\nNations Declaration.8 SECRETARY SmTriNius reported that he had\nthen pointed out to Ambassador Gromyko that the two Russian Re-\npublics had never signed this document and Ambassador Gromyko\nwithdrew his suggestion. Mr. Gromyko then urged that the sponsor-\ning governments should sign the Charter first and Secretary Stet-\ntinius had opposed this suggestion on the grounds that the Charter\nitself emphasized the sovereign equality of the participating states.\nLord Halifax had supported the Secretary\'s position on this matter\nvery strongly.

SECRETARY SMT-\nTINIUs declared that he was certain that the Russians would accept a\nsolution whereby the sponsoring nations would sign first, followed by\nFrance, and the other members in alphabetical order. Mi. Hiss\nasked whether this would be the order in which the nations would\nperform the act of signing or whether it would be the order in which\ntheir names appeared on the document. THE SECRETARY replied that\nhe was certain that the Russians intended this to mean the order in\nwhich the signatures would appear on the Charter. Marshal Smuts,\nTHE SECRETARY declared, had advanced, as his considered opinion,\n7 For summary of discussion by the Steering Committee of Document 1042,\nEX/25, June 17, "Suggestions with Respect to Schedule for Concluding\nSessions\nof the Conference", on June 21, see Doe. 1212, ST/22, June 28, UNCIO\nDocuments,\nvol. 5, pp. 288-290.
