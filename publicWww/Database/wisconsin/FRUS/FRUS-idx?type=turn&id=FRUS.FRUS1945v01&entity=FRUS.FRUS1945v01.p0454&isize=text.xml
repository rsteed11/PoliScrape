General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 392\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5 , VOLUME I\nif the question of the Soviet republics was the only issue he would tend\nto agree with Mr. Eaton, but that there were in fact other issues\nconnected with this question. The Secretary thought that frank\nrecognition should be given to the fact that there were certain military\nconsiderations that could not be discussed here. Ambassador Har-\nriman indicated that a primary motive of the Soviet Union was to\nget a position as a respected nation among the family of nations, and\nnot to go back to its former isolation. He thought that there would\nbe many issues coming up between us and that we must be morethan\ncertain not to give Russia grounds for saying that we had gone back\non the Yalta, agreement. He thought we should not raise the ques-\ntion of the invitation to the Conference at this time,. but simply live\nup to our agreement. He doubted that the situation would be' im-\nproved if we showed reluctance in living up to our agreement.\n  Senator Vandenberg commented that the problem remained to\nsatisfy the people of the United States. He said he could not escape\nthe notion-that if the first action of the Conference was to admit the\ntwo S6viet Republics the repercussions on public opinion would be\ndesperately bad. He agreed that a contract we had made would have\nto be completed, but he thought it better to postpone the completion\nuntil later. He said that he did not think that Russia had done any-\nthing to help us along the way on this question. Ambassador Harri-\nman remarked that although there were a number of actions taken by\nthe Soviet Government with which he did not agree, he did not think it\nwas fair to say that the Russians had done nothing. Senator Vanden-\nberg replied that the fundamental fact was that the American public\nwould believe that Stalin was writing the ticket.\n  Mr. Armstrong asked whether it was true that there were no other\ntime provisions on the agreements at Yalta. In connection with the\nagreement on liberated areas, he recalled that it had been stated that\nwhen we believe that conditions are unsatisfactory we shall invoke\nthe consultative procedure. He pointed out that we had invoked the\nconsultative procedure in regard to Rumania,' but that the Russians\nhad not accepted that. Mr. Dunn said that there were two periods\nto keep in mind: 1, the period of military action, and 2, the period of\npolitical action. - Rumania was still within the field of military opeir-\nations. We would have to accept this fact just as we had made the\nRussians accept our position in Italy.2\n'See Protocol of Proceedings of the Crimea Conference (II.
