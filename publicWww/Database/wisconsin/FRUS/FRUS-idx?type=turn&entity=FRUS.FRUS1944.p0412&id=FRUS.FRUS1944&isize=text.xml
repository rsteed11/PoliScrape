ITsED OF AVENGER AIRCRAFT ON BRITIsH CARRIERS\n  THE FIRST \'SEA LORD stated that the British Navy had found the\nBarracuda inadequate for carrier operations and that it was highly\ndesirable to have additional Avengers allocated for use on British\ncarriers.\n  ADMIRAL KING said that the production of Avengers was short of\nrequirements and would continue to be so, that the details of the allo-\ncation of U.S. Navy-produced aircraft were arranged by the Deputy\nChief of Naval Operations (Air) ,4 and that he, Admiral King, would\nmake sure that the question of additional Avengers for the British\nNavy would be taken under the most careful consideration, particu-\nlarly, in view of the British Fleet participation in Pacific operations.\nHe was not, however, optimistic with regard to availability of addi-\ntional Avengers for at least another six months.\n             3. RELEASE OF LST\'s FROM "\'OVERLORDXS\n  THE FIRST SEA LORD said that they were having difficulty getting\nSHAEF to release landing craft for transfer to other theaters and\nit was desirable to have some released soon for use in the Burma\noperations.\n  ADMIRAL KING said that this was a matter he wanted settled too,\nand directed that the situation be followed up with regard to release\nof landing craft and that Admiral Stark should be informed of the\nrequirements of other theaters so that he can obtain releases as quickly\nas feasible.\n  ADMIRAL COOKE said that he believed SHAEF had a certain amount\nof "velvet" and suggested that it would be well for the Combined\nChiefs of Staff to put pressure upon SHAEF to get landing craft\nreleased.\n  ADMIRAL KTING suggested that Admiral Ramsay might also be\nresponsible for holding landing craft in OVERLORD, but THE FTIRST SEA\nLORD did not concur in this.\n  ADMIRAL KING and THE FIRST SiA LORD then directed the Combined\nPlanning Staff to prepare a draft dispatch for consideration by the\nCombined Chiefs of Staff to SHAEF on release of landing craft for\ntransfer to other theaters.\n  CAPTAIN IHUGITES IHALLETT pointed out that landing craft were\noriginally made available in the theater for combatant operations only\nand were not to be kept as a convenience for incidental shipment of\nsupplies after the assault and combatant phases were over.\n\'V ice Admiral Aubrey W.
