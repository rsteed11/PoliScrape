Mu. ARMSTRONG declared that he would favor\ngiving some consideration to Mr. Evatt\'s proposal that the right of\nwithdrawal be recognized when an amendment failed of ratification\nas well as when an amendment is passed which a.- state was un-\nable to accept. M u. DuLm\'s agreed that Mr. Evatt\'s proposal,. al-\nthough it had since been withdrawn, was an excellent suggestion. MR.\nPAsvOLsKY pointed out, however, that the question required careful\nconsideration. He asked what would be the case if the United States\nrefused to ratify an amendment by which additional responsibilities\nand\'obligations would be -imposed upon the United States. Under\nMr. Evatt\'s proposal any state could withdraw from the Organization\nunder these circumstances, and upon\'the United States\' would fall the\nonus of having broken up the Organization. Mi. PASVOISKY ex-\npressed the opinion that too much of a "smoke screen" was being\nlaid\nwith respect to the ability of China and France to assume the obliga-\ntions of big powers. COMMANDER STASSEN thought that the question\nshould be considered realistically. Commander Stassen pointed out\nthat in his opinion if there were sufficient pressure in the Organization\nto cause a breakup, the Organization would dissolve. - This would be\ntrue with respect to the situation which Mr. Pasvolsky had outlined.\nCommander Stassen thought that the United States could not insist\non acceptance of all its demands and still attempt to force the other\nmembers of the Organization to remain in the Organization. MR.\nHICKERsoN agreed that, if the United States opposed an amendment\nwhich all the other nations were in favor of, then the United States,\nunder Mr. Evatt\'s scheme, would have to bear the responsibility for\nsmashing the Organization. COMMANDER ,STASSEN thought that Mr.\nEvatt\'s proposal was a sound one in as much as it constituted a kind\nof sanction by the United Nations on the use of the veto power by\nthe major powers. He thought it was a completely unobjectionable\nprovision. MR. PASVOLSKY asked Commander Stassen whether he\nthought acceptance could be gained for the elimination of the last\npart of paragraph 3, leaving only the first sentence thereof. Cox-\nMANDER STASSEN thought that acceptance would be gained\' but that\nit would probably require two weeks of negotiation and approval.\nAM. PASVOLSKY thought that, if the second half of the paragraph were\nto be dropped, there could be no doubt of the applicability of the\noriginal phraseology of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. COMMAND-\nER STASSEN urged, however, that there would be little chance of\ngaining approval for such a revision in less than a week, but Mu.\nPASVOLSKY replied that approval would have to be gained for the other\nalternatives also.
