General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1157\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nthe situation was to be discussed at all, but merely as to [in] which\norder it would be discussed.\n  AMBASSADOR GROMYKo then said that in his understanding, Mr.\nPasvolsky divided the Council procedure into two parts: first, a,\nnation would bring a situation to the attention of the Security Coun-\ncil and the Security Council would give it a hearing; thereafter, after\nthe hearing was closed, the Security Council would proceed to discuss\nthe matter and vote as to whether it should deal with the matter or\nnot. Further, he pointed out that it was his understanding of the\nU.S. viewpoint that in this latter decision the Security Council would\nact on a procedural vote. MR. PASvoLSKY said that he had been mis-\nunderstood, that such discussion could proceed with or without a\nvote, and that, in his view, a vote at that time was not mandatory.\nHe said it was his understanding, of course, that a vote could be had.\nas to whether or not such discussion should be stopped in the event.\nthat it appeared that continuing the discussion would further aggra-\nvate the situation. In such a case, he said the veto vote would obvi-\nously apply, and THE SECRETARY agreed with him. MR. GOLUNSEY\nsaid that in such a veto vote, any one member of the Council could\nprevent the discussion from being stopped; but the U.S. Delegation.\nwas unwilling to agree that the veto of any one of the members could,\nnot prevent [could prevent?] the discussions from being started.\nAMBASSADOR GROMYEo said that the entire matter had narrowed downs\nin his own mind as to a question of whether a procedural or a non--\nprocedural vote should govern the question as to whether the Councils\nshould discuss a matter. MR. PASVOLSKY said that that was too nar-y\nrow an interpretation; that a vote on that issue could not be taken.\n  THE SECRETARY said that he had always emphasized in his own.\nstatements the necessity for a free hearing and an opportunity to.\ndiscuss a situation brought before the Council. AMBAssADOR GROMyKO\nsaid that in spite of the Secretary's statements, it was the sense of the&amp;\nCrimea decision that a vote would have to be taken in the Council\nas to whether or not a discussion should proceed. After a brief inter-\nchange, Ambassador Gromyko asked the Secretary if he could see him.\nprivately for a few minutes and they both left the room.\n  During their absence, discussion of the matter continued between\nMessrs. Golunsky and Pasvolsky. MR. GOLUNSiY said that if he\nunderstood the U. S. viewpoint correctly, it was that no one member\nof the Security Council could prevent a situation being brought to,\nthe Council's attention b-ut, he said, in the Soviet view, a decision\nwas still required as to, whether or nQot the Council should proceed\nto a discussion of that situation,. Further, he said, it was his under--\nstandig that the U.
