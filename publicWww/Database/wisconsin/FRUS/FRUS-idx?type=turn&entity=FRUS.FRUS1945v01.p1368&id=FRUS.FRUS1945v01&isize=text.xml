Secretary-General shall call\nsuch a conference to be held at a convenient date between the tenth\nand twelfth years inclusive."\n  MR. PAsvoisKY thought that it was not within the powers of the\nSecretary-General to call a revisionary conference but MR. HIcKERSoN\nobserved that specific authority would be provided in the Charter for\nthis power if Commander Stassen\'s suggestion were adopted. Cox-\nMANDER STASSEN also suggested that Senator Rolin\'s proposal that a\n2 majority, including the permanent members of the Security Coun-\ncil, be accepted in place of a simple majority, including the permanent\nmembers, as previously proposed. COMMANDER STASSEN reiterated\nthat he thought it was important that a liberal attitude be maintained\nwith respect to non-critical issues.\n  SENATOR CONNALY observed that there had been a great deal of\nenthusiasm for Mr. Armstrong\'s amendment to the effect that a revi-\nsionary conference be placed on the agenda of the General Assembly\nduring the tenth year.69 MR. HcKERSON thought that this enthusiasm\nhad been lost as the meeting progressed. Mr. Hickerson declared\nthat he agreed with Commander Stassen that the Delegation should\ntake a liberal attitude with respect to issues which were not vital. He\npointed out that the newspaper headlines were quite unfavorable, em-\nphasizing as they did the fact that the Big Five had opposed setting\na definite date for the calling of a revisionary convention. Mr. Hick-\nerson suggested a provision be inserted in the Charter that a revi-\nsionary convention be held every ten years. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM\npointed out that to his knowledge there was nothing in the Charter\nwhich would prevent having revisionary conferences periodically.\nMR. HICKERsoN agreed that such conventions could be called at any\ntime according to the desires of the member states and he observed\nthat no real concession would be involved. Mr. Hickerson thought\nthat it was the gesture that was important. COMMANDER STASSEN\npointed out that there was a feeling among the smaller states that\nthey had failed to attain the necessary 2/3 majority because of the votes\nof those states which customarily followed the lead of the U.S.S.R.\nand the United States. Because of this, they were somewhat doubtful\nof their ability to garner the necessary 2/3 vote for calling a convention\nin the future. In effect they were being told that a revisionary con-\nvention would be held in the future if 2/3 of the members of the\nOrganization were in favor of such a convention immediately after\nthey had failed in an attempt to achieve a 2/3 majority on this issue.\n"Doc. 1015, I/2/68, June 16, UNCIO Documents, vol. 7, p. 220; see also\nDoc.\n1022, I/2/69, June 16, ibid., p. 229.\n1306\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1368&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1368&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1368&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1368&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1368&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1368&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1368&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1367&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1369&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1367&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1369&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1368&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
