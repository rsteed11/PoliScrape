A number of amendments\nwere proposed and agreed to. These are incorporated in the final report\n(C.C.S. 680/2).2\n  In addition to the agreed amendments, comments on the report were\nm1iade as follows:\n                       OPERATIONS IN ITALY\na. Paragirap -11\n  THEI PRiME rMINISTER suggested that the alternative developments in\nthe operations in Italy postulated by General Wilson 3 were rather too\nrigid. There might be many shades between the rout of General Kes-\nsehlrm g\'s forces and the ability of the Germans to effect an orderly with-\ndraINwal. Paragraphs 11 a and b would present a better balanced esti-\nm-ate if paragraph 11 b was amended to read "b. Kesselring\'s Army\nvii succeed in effecting an orderly withdrawal, in which event it does\nriot at pResent seem possible that we can do more than clear the Lom-\nbardyT Plains this year. Uldess the eneiry\'s resistance is markedly\nreduced, difficult terrain and severe weather in the Alps during the\nw inter would prevent another major offensive until spring 1945."\nh7. 7Pa-1araraph 12\n  TuI, PRIME MINISTER asked that the precise implication of the state-\nment "that no major units should be withdrawn from Italy until the\noult-cone of General Alexander\'s present offensive is known" might be\nmade perfectly clear. For example, it would be quite unacceptable if\nparazrapph 12 a was intended to cover an offensive only as far, say, as\nthe Rinmini Line. He assumed that the offensive contemplated would\ninclude domination of the Valley of the Po.\n  GENTERAL MARSHALL said it was his understanding that General\nAlexander\'s present offensive included invasion of the Valley of the Po.\n  ADMIRAL LEAT-IY agreed.\nc. Paragraph 12 c\n  TILE PRIME MINISTER expressed his appreciation to Admiral King\nfor his offer to provide an amphibious lift for possible operations\nagainst the Istrian Peninsula.4\n  ADMIRAL KING said that after taking part in operations in the\nAdriatic, these landing craft would be required to proceed to the\nSoutheast Asia Theater for DRACULA. It was therefore of the greatest\nimportance that General Wilson should submit his plan for the Istrian\n  \'"Report to the President and Prime Minis,,ter", September 15,\n1944.
