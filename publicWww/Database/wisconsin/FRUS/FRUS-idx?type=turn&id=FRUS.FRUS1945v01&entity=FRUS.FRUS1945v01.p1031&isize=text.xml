Although\nthe end of committee work by Saturday night had been set as a target,\nthe proceedings were dragging in the committees and action to speed\nthem up was necessary. It was a mistake to think that the fault was\nentirely with the middle or small powers. Some of the responsibility\nfor the delay was with the big powers, since several of the technical\ncommittees were waiting for them to speak. There was need for a\nfrank discussion of the problem. Perhaps a deadline could be estab-\nlished for committee work and if it was not completed in time, all\nunfinished work would go direct to the Steering Committee. A sug-\ngestion along this line could come from a middle or small country.\nHowever, for this to be dbne it was necessary first to discuss when the\ndelegations represented at this meeting could end their discussion on\nmajor pending problems.\n  LORD HALIFAX said he had not had time to think the matter through\nbut was wondering to what extent the delay kwas due to the five powers\nor to the committees.

MR. Hiss rec-\nommended that the latter, agree with the Chairman of Committee 1/2\non issues which could come to a vote. If the issues 'were lost thei\nthe matter could be referred to the, Steering Committee. MR. Hiss\nthought that an agreement could be reached today, perhaps after\nthe meeting, on the questions which -could be voted upon and; men-\ntioned specifically. expulsion and the Secretary General and the Dep-\nuties. LQID HALIAx thought that none of the Five Powers were\nresponsible for the delay in I/2 but that nevertheless he Would im-\npress on the British representatives on that (Committee to get in touch\nwith the representatives of the other great powers so that the work\ncould be expedited.-,\n  MR. Hiss, continued with his summary of the status of committee\nwork.
