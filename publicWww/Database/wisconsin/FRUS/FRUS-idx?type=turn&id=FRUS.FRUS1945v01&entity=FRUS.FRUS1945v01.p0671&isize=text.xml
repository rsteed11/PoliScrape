General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 609\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nernments concerned in Chapter XII, also to take measures under\nthe amendment and to be a party to any agreements that might be\nmade for the transfer of the responsibilities under Chapter XII to\n'the Security Council.\n  At this point, THE SECRETARY said that he would like to poll the\nDelegation regarding their views on the amendment.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said that he liked Mr. Pasvolsky's proposal\n-as it stood; that the Delegation would not be eternally committed to\nit, and that the Delegation could modify it, later in the Conference\nif necessary.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY and REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said they would\naccept Mr. Pasvolsky's p.roposdl.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE said that while she would accept the proposal,\nshe still hoped that some attempt could be made to incorporate Mr.\nStassen's idea into the proposal.\n  At this point in the discussions, MR. STASSEN said that in his view,\nFrance under the proposed amendment could move without the\nconsent of the Security Council at some future date, and this was\nwhat he was attempting to prevent. MaI. BOWMAN suggested that\nin view of Mr. Stassen's strong opinions on this subject, some further\nattempt might be made to modify Mr. Pasvolsky's proposal. MR.\nSTAsSEN replied that in his view it would be better to omit altogether\nany amendments to this Section.\n  In response to a specific question from Senator Connally, MR.\nMCCwY said that, representing the Army and Navy, he wished to\nexpress his agreement with Mr. Pasvolsky's proposal.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY said that what had to be kept in mind was that the\nFrench and the Soviet Governments were trying to build a treaty\nsystem based on their continued fear of Germany; that such treaty\nsystem had to work-in the last analysis-without the assistance of\nthe United States, since European Governments still- were not sure\nthat the continuing participation of the United States in the future\ncontrol of Germany could be assured. For this reason, he said that\nit was impossible to keep Europe from building a defensive system\nagainst a renewed threat of German aggression and that he felt that\nif this proposed amendment, which was entirely consistent with the\nprovisions of Chapter XII, could be accepted by the Delegation,\nit would be nothing more than a restatement of the position that had\nalways been understood since Dumbarton Oaks.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG indicated that he agreed with Mr. Pasvolsky.\n  The Secretary adjourned the meeting at 7:40 p. m. in order that\ncertain members of the Delegation could rejoin the meeting of the\nfour Foreign Ministers.\n609,\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
