General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 875\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nembarrassed at having to reverse their decision, but MR. PASVOLMKY\ndeclared the French would support this statement. The Committee\nhad worked until one o\'clock this morning, with Mr. Armstrong\nand Dr. Bowman present, as well as other people from time to time,\nincluding Gladwyn Jebb of the British Delegation.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN remarked that in order to maintain consist-\nency with this document it would be logical to withdraw the exception\nestablished concerning the power of parties to a dispute to veto\nSection A. MR. DuLLEs agreed and said this was especially true in\nview of the phraseology appearing in the last sentence on Page 2\nwhere it was declared that "it would be absurd for some dispute-not\nonly affecting the peace and security of the world in general, but also\nof direct interest to one of the five members having primary responsi-\nbility for the maintenance of peace and security-to be dealt with\nwithout regard to, or even over the objection of, that member." If\nthis were true, he asked, why should a permanent member, party to a\ndispute, not have a veto over Section A as well as Section B? COM-\nMANDER STASSEN remarked that this exception to the veto power of\nthe- permanent members of the Security Council had been the chief\ninterest of President Roosevelt and that the phraseology in this\nstatement was a ridiculous contradiction.\n  SECRETARY STEriNIUs asked Mr. Pasvolsky whether he had re-\nported to the Delegation on his talk with Ambassador Gromyko which\nMr. Pasvolsky was to have had shortly after the Secretary left for\nWashington. MR. PASVOLSKY replied that this paper represented the\nview of the Russian Delegation. SECRETARY STEMNrus asked\nwhether Mr. Pasvolsky thought that the Russians would support this\npaper and COMMANDER STASSEN interjected that the Russians un-\ndoubtedly would support it "enthusiastically".\n  MR. PASVOLSKY conceded that MY. Dulles\' point was a good one\nbut MR. PASVOLsKY did not think there was an inconsistency involved.\nObviously, he said, a power involved in a dispute should not be allowed\nto vote on questions involving the initial stages of the Organiza-\ntion\'s handling of the matter. If a state is not involved in a dispute\ninitially the problem is whether it could accept a situation where it\nmight be involved in the dispute against its consent.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN pointed out that this statement involved the\nposition that Sections A and B of Chapter VIII were inseparable,\nwhereas the President had succeeded at Yalta in separating the two\nparts of the Chapter. MR. DULLEs agreed with Commander Stassen\nthat this draft had the effect of reuniting the two sections. CoM-\nMANDER STASSEN went on to point out that the draft said in effect\nthat the Organization should never take action on a dispute unless the\nstates members were willing eventually to use force. This was not\nnecessarily so because it would be possible for all the states concerned\n875\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0936&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0936&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0938&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0937&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
