I\nwith Mr. Armstrong, Lord Halifax remarked that he then saw the\nquestion in an entirely different light. AIR. PASVOLSKY urged that\nsince France would have a veto power on the Security Council anyL\nhow there was actually, in the final analysis, no difference between\nthe two wordings. COMMANDER STASSEN asked why, if there was no\ndifference between the two wordings, the French were so anxious to\nmake a revision. COMMANDER STASSEN urged that the French propo-\nsition be made public in order to gain the reaction of the; American\npublic and the other nations present at the Conference. COMMANDER\nSTASSEN declared that he was irrevocably opposed to the change at\nthis point and could be brought around only by a public mandate.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY said that in his opinion there was no substan-\ntive difference between the two wordings and he favored accepting\nthe French proposal provided that it were certain that the matter\nwould be ended by this action, and that the paragraph would not be\nreopened to other general propositions.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN disagreed with Senator Connally and de-\nclared that the new wording carried the implication that the United\nStates would be backing out of Europe, and SENATOR CONNALLY\nreplied that this referred only to the enemy states.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN remarked that he was opposed even to that.\nUnder the Dumbarton Oaks wording the United States had been one\n,of the responsible powers, but under this new wording which-recog-\nnized the mutual assistance pacts, the United States could not possibly\nbe a party. MR. DULLEs asked whether Commander Stassen could\nthink of any action which the French might take under their new\ndraft which they could not have taken under the old draft. COM-\nMANDER STASSEN replied that under the original wording the Orga-\nnization had the responsibility for taking enforcement actions, and\nthat only the individual right of self-defense was recognized. How-\never, the new draft carried the implication that authority would never\nbe turned over to the Organization with respect to enemy states. MR.\nPASVOLSKY pointed out to the Delegation that the United States had\nthe right to conclude a pact similar to the Franco-Russian pact with\nany European state and would thus fall under this provision. 1H6w-\never, MR. PASVOLSKY was of the opinion that even this was not nec-\nessary because of the provisions of Chapter XII, paragraph 2.\n  COMMANDER STASSEN agreed it would be logical to rely on mutual\nassistance pacts if the United States were going to back out of the\nOrganization with respect to Europe. MR. PASVOLSKY referred once\nagain to paragraph 2 of Chapter XII under which the rights of the\nUnited States were reserved with respect to enemy states. No pacts\nwould be necessary, he declared; and Mr. Dunn agreed- that the\nUnited States could act without concluding any arrangements.
