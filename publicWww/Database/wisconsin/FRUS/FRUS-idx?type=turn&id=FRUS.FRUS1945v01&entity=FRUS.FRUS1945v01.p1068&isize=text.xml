General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1006\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\nthat under the original draft, it had been considered a great victory\nto have achieved mention of Chapter XII, Paragraph 2. Once this\nreference had been included in the paragraph, all the states concerned\nwith the interim arrangements for the supervision of enemy states\nbecame concerned with the matters involved in Chapter VIII, Sec-\ntion C, Paragraph 2. The Russian delegates, he declared, had accepted\nthis interpretation and it had been universally assumed that the word-\ning referred to both types of arrangements, the bi-lateral regional\npacts as well as the arrangements whereby certain states would be\ncharged with the responsibility for supervising enemy nations during\nthe interim period. SENATOR VANDENBERG asked whether Mr. Pas-\nvolsky would inform him as to which governments would be con-\ncerned in turning over the responsibilities involved in an Anglo-\nRussian treaty to the Organization. MR. PASVOLSKY replied that\nGreat Britain and Russia could stop exercising their powers over\nsuch a treaty at any time they so desired. However, MR. PASVOLSKY\ndeclared that that did not mean that Great Britain and Russia could\nhave the Organization take over those powers. When the Organi-\nzation assumed jurisdiction over the matters previously under the\njurisdiction of a regional arrangement, no such treaty would any\nlonger be consistent with the powers of the Security Council. How-\never, when two parties to such a regional arrangement give up their\ntreaty, the powers under that treaty would pass not to the Organiza-\ntion but to those nations responsible for exercising control over enemy\nstates during the interim period. MR. PASVOLSKY declared that it\nwas not the case that the number of states whose consent was neces-\nsary for the assumption of jurisdiction by the Organization was re-\nduced by the relinquishment of any bi-lateral treaty. MR. DuLLES\nsaid that he could understand that the Security Council might have\nto reach an agreement to assume jurisdiction but he could still not\nsee the necessity for bringing in Australia on that decision. MR.\nPAsvoLSKY declared that Australia would already be in by virtue of\nChapter XII, Paragraph 2, and MR. DULLES added that this might\nbe true insofar as Australia was responsible for maintaining the sur-\nrender terms. MR. DuLIEs declared that obviously it was necessary\nto have an agreement by the parties to each regional arrangement\nthat the Organization should assume jurisdiction as they recognized\nthat there was no longer any need for the bi-lateral pact. However,\nMR. DULLES reiterated that he could not see why Australia should have\nany relation to an Anglo-Russian treaty.\n  MR. KANE declared that if Mr. Pasvolsky were correct in his inter-\npretation and that was the way the U.S.S.R. interpreted Chapter XII,\nParagraph 2, then consideration should be given to the advisability\nof revising Chapter XII, Paragraph 2. MR. PAsVOLSKY replied that\n1006\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1068&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1068&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1068&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1068&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1068&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1068&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1068&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1067&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1069&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1067&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1069&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1068&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
