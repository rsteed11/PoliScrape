General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 750\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5, VOLUME I\n    RECOMMENDATIONS ON PREAMBLE, PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES\n          (CoMxnri= I/1, US GEN 110, MAY 16, 1945)\n  THE SECRETARY stated that the Delegation had before it recommen-\ndations with regard to the amendments proposed by other countries\nand that the position of the Delegation should be established with\nregard to those proposals. He expressed the hope that the work in\nthe Committees could be concluded within the next ten days. MR.\nBLOOM stated that he would like to take up first those matters which\nwere currently under consideration in the Committees and on which\na decision of the Delegation was required immediately. MR. PAsvoL-\nSKY replied that that was what he hoped the Delegation could do.\n  ME. PAsVOLSKY referred to the series of documents on Recommenda-\ntions to United States Delegation on Basic Issues (US Gen 110, 111,\n112, 113, 114, and 116 43) and stated that recommendations had been\nprepared on the principal issues before the Conference. THE SECRE-\nTARY suggested that the Delegation go through these recommenda-\ntions in a systematic way and pointed out that the recommendations\nin these documents referred only to the questions before the Com-\nmittees of Commissions I and II. MR. HACKWORTH stated that if\none of the issues now being considered in Committee IV// is not\ndecided this morning it would be too late for us to make our position\nknown. MR. SANDIFER stated that the question Mr. Hackworth was\ninterested in, namely the membership of neutral states in the Court,\nwas listed as item 3 on the agenda for this morning.\n  MR. PASVOLSKgY stated that the Delegation had gone through the\nfirst three items on Preamble, Purposes and Principles (US Gen\n110) yesterday afternoon. MR. SANDIFER added that the Delegation\nhad approved items a, b, and c of this paper and had tentatively ap-\nproved item d, subject to Mr. Hackworth's concurrence.\n  MR. HACKWORTH stated that he believed it would be unfortunate\nif no provision were made in the Charter in which members of the\nOrganization would be obligated to refrain from intervention. He\nreferred to the non-intervention agreements in a number of the Latin\nAmerican agreements and suggested that if we did not subscribe to\nthe insertion in the Charter of such a provision he feared that the\nLatin American countries would misunderstand our position. DR.\nBOWMAN inquired whether these Latin American agreements were not\nin themselves a sufficient offset to make it unnecessary to make any\nprovision in the Charter for an obligation to refrain from interven-\ntion in the internal affairs of other countries. MR. HACKwORTH re-\nplied that he could not answer that question without examining the\nprovisions contained in the many documents on this subject. He re-\niterated the view that non-intervention clauses have been a focal point\n  '3Dated May 16, none printed.\n750\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0812&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0812&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0812&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0812&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0812&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0812&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0812&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0811&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0813&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0811&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0813&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0812&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
