SECRETARY STETTINIUs asked whether Mr. Pas-\nvolsky would go back to his Committee and suggest these changes and\nthe latter replied that he thought any further consideration of para-\ngraph 5 was closed. If it were brought up again he thought that the\nother powers would retreat along other- linies. He was, however, will-\ning to reopen paragraphs 9 and 10. SECRPrARY STETriNNis remarked\nthat if \'Mr. Pasvolsky would put through the suggested change in\nparagraph 10\'it would ease the situation. MR. PASVOLSKYs declared\nthat he thought he could get the changes in paragraphs 9 and 10\naccepted if he were able to promise that the United States would\naccept the revised draft.\n  MR. DULLES remarked that he had spoken with Prime Minister\nFraser and that the latter had seemed discouraged because of the\nrecent amendments which, he declared, relieved the\' Security Council\nof the obligation to take further steps after ordering an investigation.\nIf this were true, MR. DtuLLEs said there would be good grounds for\ndeleting paragraph 6 because of its lack of finality. MR. PASVOLSKY\nvoiced the opinion that Mr. Fraser\'s interpretation had been incorrect.\nThe trouble -was that the British and the Dominions had been intro-\nducing a number of changes without understanding -the full\nimplications.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY asked if Commander Stassen would accept\nparagraph 5 if paragraphs 9 and 10 were amended. COMMANDtR\nSTASSEN reiterated that-the word "usually" should be inserted in\'para-\ngraph 4. MR. PAsVOLsKY remarked that he thoughtthat- objection\nwas covered by the alternative possibilities included in this sentence.\nSENATOR VANDENBERG remarked that the chain may begin but does\nnot always have to finish. MR. DmIs remarked that the undertaking\nof an investigation might not always lead. to force but that, on the\nother hand, it sometimes might. COMMANDER STASSEN reiterated his\ndesire to have "may"\' substituted for "would" in paragraph\n5. If\nparagraphs 9 and 10 were straightened out he declared he would leave\nit to Mr. Panvolsky\'s ability as a negotiator to work on paragraphs\n4 and 5. DEAN GILDERSLEVE indicated that she was very strongly\nin favor of Mr. Pasvolsky\'s last version of paragraph 10.\n                      FRENCH AMENDMENTS\n   GENERAL FAIRCHILD replied that the French had been trying to\n push through amendments to paragraphs 5, 6 and 9 of Chapter VIII,\n Section B.29 These amendments would come up for discussion in\n Monday\'s meeting of Committee 111/3.30 The military advisers of\n the Five Powers had wanted discussions with the idea of establishing\n   Doc. 2, G/7(o), March 21, UNCIO Documents, vol. 3, pp. 386-387.\n   , Doe. 649, III/3/34, May 28, ibid., vol. 12, p. 391.\n\'921\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
