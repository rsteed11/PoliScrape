General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1277\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nout that several Latin -American Delegates had originally wanted\nthe phrase "after agreement with", but that this hod been changed\nto\n"after consultation", and in that form had -been adopted by the\ntech-\nnical committee. After originally agreeing to this latter phrase, the\nSoviets had decided-that they did not like it and MR. HIoKF~soN\nthought that, if we reopen the question now, we may have trouble.\nThe Soviets, he said, wanted to add a sentence to the effect that the\nparagraph did not in any way limit the freedom of action of the\nMilitary Staff Conmmittee -or of the Security Council. They were\nafraid that the word "consultation" might be interpreted to mean\n"agreement" and so would provide opportunity for obstruction.\nNeither MR. KANE nor GENERAL EMBICKil saw any objection to use\nof the phrase "after an exchange of views" but thought it undesirable\nto reopen debate on the matter. It was agreed to accept the phrase\n"an exchange of views" if this language were found agreeable to\nthe\nFive Powers and if it proved acceptable to Peru and others concerned\nso that it would not have to be put to a debate in the Committee. It\nwas suggested that, if this were generally acceptable, the change\ncould be handled as a matter of drafting in the Coordination\nCommittee.\nTIME OF REMOVAL OF "RESTRIOTRED" FROM CONFERENCE DOCUMENTS\n                   PROVISION FOR WITHDRAWAL\n  The Delegation returned to a discussion of the provision for amend-\nment of the Charter and withdrawal from the Organization, MR.\nARMSTRONG saying that the meeting of the Big Five had ledft the\nsituation with respect to withdrawal unclear.83 The American Dele-\ngation, he recalled, had hoped that the smaller nations would not\npress for a withdrawal clause but that their desire in this connection\nwould be satisfied by the insertion of- an interpretive, statement in\nthe record. The Soviet Delegate, he said, intends to push for incor-\nporation of a general withdrawal clause in the Charter., He also\nreported that after the second part of paragraph 3 of Chapter XI (a\nfour power amendment) had been adopted by the subcommittee of\nCommittee I/2 the previous evening, the Delegate of Canada had\nremarked that his Delegation would have to press for a withdrawal\nclause.84 The smaller powers, MR. ARMSTRONG remarked, are inclined\nto consider the proposal for a revision conference a mere front in\nview of the present provision for the roperation of a veto in the ac-\nceptance. of amendments proposed by such a conference.
