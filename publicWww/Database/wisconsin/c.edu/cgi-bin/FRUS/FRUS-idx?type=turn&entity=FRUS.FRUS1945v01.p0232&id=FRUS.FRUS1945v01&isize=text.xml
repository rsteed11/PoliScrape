General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 170\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nwere now engaged in slaughtering thousands of men and expending\nbillions of dollars in an attempt to destroy the enemy only to be com-\ning out with a plan for the domination of the world. He felt con-\nvinced that the substance of the plan for world organization was the\ndomination of the world by four or five of the great states. He in-\ndicated that he would prefer to try to lay the firm foundations for\nthe peace after the necessary adjustments had been made to settle the\nissues of the war.\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON thought the justification for the United\nStates having three votes on the grounds that Great Britain had six\nvotes was fallacious. He said that the Dominions had declared war\nfor themselves, would terminate their part in the war as they saw fit,\nnow sent their own ambassadors, and were in fact free and independent\nnations.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked whether the President himself was\nactually in favor of the 3-3 6 formula. THE SECRETARY replied that\nthe President\'s position is that, if Russia insists on three representa-\ntives and the, Conference accepts this position, then he would insist\nupon three votes for the United States. SENATOR VANDENBERG\nthought that the tenor of the anouncement was that this Government\nwas now committed to the Soviet proposal. THE SECRETARY replied\nthat the decision was left up to the Conference itself. SENATOR VAN-\nDENBRG felt that this should have been made clearer in the announce-\nment. THE SECRETARY then asked Mr. MacLeish to read the White\nHouse statement." MR. MAoLLSH read as follows:\n  "Soviet representatives at the Yalta Conference indicated their\ndesire to raise at the San Francisco Conference of the United Nations,\nthe question of representation for the Ukrainian Soviet Republic and\nthe White Russian Soviet Republic in the assembly of the proposed\nUnited Nations organization.\n  "The American and British representatives at the Yalta Conference\nwere requested by the Soviet representatives to support this proposal\nwhen submitted to the conference of the United Nations at San Fran-\ncisco. They agreed to do so, but the American representatives stated\nthat if the United Nations organization agreed to let the Soviet repub-\nlics have three votes, the United States would ask for three votes also.\n  "\'The British and Soviet representative stated that they would have\nno objection to the United States and its possessions having three\nvotes in the Assembly if it is so desired.\n  "These conversations at Yalta related to the submission of a ques-\ntion to the San Francisco conference where the ultimate decision will\nbe made."\n  THE SECRETARY noted that the statement emphasized that the matter\nwas open for decision by the Conference.\n  53 Press release issued by the White House, March 29;
