General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 559\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nit would not be possible to issue the proposals at this time, agreement\nhad been reached that Mr. Stassen would leave the meeting of the\nfour sponsoring governments and attend a press conference at 11 a. m.,\nThursday, on behalf of the whole Delegation.\n  THE SECRETARY asked MR. STASSEN tO summarize the statement he\nwould make to the press conference. . . . He said he would indicate\nthat the present consultations were a continuation of those held the\nprevious evening, and that he would stress that consultation was going\nforward on amendments which each of the four governments wished\nto propose for discussion along with the consideration of the Dumbar-\nton Oaks Proposals.

PASVOLSKY said the Organization could not impose a decision on\nthis question but that it could say to them, "you are violating a pur-\n)ose of the Organization".

PASVOLSKY explained that the word\n"iequal" was a touchy one with the Russians, and that from his\npoint\nof view the phrase "without distinction" was actually better than\n"equal". REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM asked whether Mr. Pasvolsky meant\nto say that the Declaration of Independence was wrong. MR.
