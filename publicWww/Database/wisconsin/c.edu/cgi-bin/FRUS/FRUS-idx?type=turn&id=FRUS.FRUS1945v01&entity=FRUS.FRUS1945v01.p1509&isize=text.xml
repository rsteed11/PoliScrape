PREPARATORY COMMISSION\nourselves before the ExCom meeting yesterday. It was clear Mon-\nday at ExCom meeting that Noel-Baker was stalling on this question.\nHe has told me that he was not sure the British could hold the con-\nstituent meeting in London, and that he was anxious to hold a final\nmeeting of the League Assembly in Geneva during December and the\nfirst meeting of the General Assembly of United Nations Organiza-\ntion in January, also in Geneva.\n  I do not believe it is possible to hold a meeting of the General As-\nsembly in December except in London. We therefore have had to\nconsider the possibility of postponing the meeting of the General\nAssembly until January at some location other than London.\n  I reviewed this matter with Koo and Gromyko together and we\nagree that there were only two acceptable alternatives: 1, that the\nGeneral Assembly should meet around December 1st in London: or 2,\nthat it should meet early in January in the United States. Koo and I\npreferred the former, Gromyko preferred the latter, but seemed ready\nto withdraw his objection to London, if urged.\n  Noel-Baker advised me that he would not be prepared to reach a\ndecision between these two alternatives for 2 weeks. I told him this\nwas not satisfactory and later asked Massigli to postpone the meeting\nof ExCom arranged for yesterday morning and to call instead an\ninformal meeting of the Big Five to thrash out this problem in a frank\ndiscussion. Noel-Baker strongly resisted in a Big Five meeting on\nthe grounds that he had not been able to get a decision from Mr. Bevin,\nand I finally gave in on the understanding that he would be prepared\nto reach a decision on these two questions within 3 or 4 days.\n  At the ExCom meeting yesterday, by agreement, we postponed\nuntil Monday discussion of the time and place of the first meeting\nof the General Assembly (reference our Copre 91).\n  We feel that Noel-Baker\'s plan for a full dress final meeting of the\nLeague in December in Geneva, followed within 2 or 3 weeks by the\nfirst meeting of the General Assembly also in Geneva, would be a\nmistake. In preliminary discussions, I have, without formally ob-\njecting to it, indicated this view. I would prefer to see the League\npass away quietly and with dignity, and doubt that any apology for\nthe expulsion of the Soviet Union would make them more amenable\nto Geneva. A highly publicized full dress final meeting of the\nLeague in Geneva would detract from United Nations Organization\nand if followed by the first meeting of the General Assembly in\nGeneva might invite cynical comment and do United Nations Orga-\nnization positive injury at home.\n  I discussed this matter with Secretary Byrnes 22 who agreed with\nthis view generally. I propose therefore in future discussions to try\n  " The Secretary of State was in London at this time, attending the\nmeetings\nof the Council of Foreign Ministers.\n     723-681-67-95\n1447\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0009.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0009.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1509&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1509&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1509&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1509&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1509&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1509&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1509&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0009.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0008&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0010&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1495&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1508&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1510&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0009.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0008&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0010&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1495&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1508&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1510&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1509&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
