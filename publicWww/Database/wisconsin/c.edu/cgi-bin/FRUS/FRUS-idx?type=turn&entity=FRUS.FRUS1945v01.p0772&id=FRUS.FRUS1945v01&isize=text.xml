MR.\nDULLES thought the Eden draft not quite as satisfactory as the original\nAmerican text, as the narrowing expression "armed attack" applies\nin\nthis draft both to the individual and collective rights of self defense.\nHe felt that the individual right should not be curtailed in any way.\nIn reply to a query from Mr. Gates he said that the Eden draft cov-\nered the right of a Latin American state if attacked by another.\n  It was agreed that Mr. Gates should phone Mr. McCloy for his\nviews and that the Secretary and Senators Connally and Vandenberg\nwould try to get together with a small group of Latin Americans about\n2: 30 p. m. MR. DUNN remarked that the Soviet and French reactions\ncould not be obtained today and, in reply to a query from Dr. Bow-\nman, said that he thought the idea of a separate protocol by the five\ncovering their understanding about the Act of Chapultepec would be\nvery dangerous.

STETTINIus replied that there would be many refinements\nof language before a document was finally agreed upon. SENATOR\nCONNALLY commented that we have not done a thing to abrogate\nor modify the Monroe Doctrine. We certainly have not done so in\nso far as our power to enforce that document is concerned. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG said that hitherto our veto in the Security Council had\nbeen a guarantee that the organization could not take action against\nan American republic and that with the present arrangement we have\nclosed the last loophole.\n  The Delegation agreed to reject the insertion in paragraph 1 of\nChapter VIII, C of the words "or collective arrangements like that\ncontemplated by the Act of Chapultepec."\n  SECRETARY\'S PROPOSED PRESS STATEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS 94\n                ELECTION OF SECRETARY GENERAL\n  CONGRESSMAN BLOOM stated that there had been discussion in his\nCommittee (II/1) regarding the relationship of the Security Council\nand the Assembly in regard to the election of the Secretary General.95\nIt was agreed that the Security Council should nominate the Secretary\nGeneral for election by the Assembly and that the Mexican proposal\n94 For statement on human rights made by Mr. Stettinius at San Francisco\non\nMay 15, see Department of State Bulletin, May 20, 1945, p. 928.\n95 Doc. 295, II/1/11,/ May 14, UNCIO Documents, vol. 8, p. 317.\n710\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169;
