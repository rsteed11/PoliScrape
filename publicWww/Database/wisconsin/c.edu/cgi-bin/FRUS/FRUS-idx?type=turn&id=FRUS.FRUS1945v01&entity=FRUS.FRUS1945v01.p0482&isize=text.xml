Representative Bloom queried why some such restriction should\nnot be put in here.\n  Mr. Pasvolsky asked the group how the matter should be handled.\nMr. Dulles said he thought that the word "measures" should be read\nin the context of the next paragraphs. He could see that it would in-\nclude invoking sanctions in order to prevent nations from going to\nwar, but he thought it would be going too far to decide substantive\nquestions and remake the world economically and socially. He sug-\ngested that the phrase be amended to read: "measures of the character\nhereinafter referred to". Senator Connally thought this would be\ntoo broad because it might be taken to refer to all the rest of the\nCharter. Mr. Dulles said that in that case it could be restricted to\nthe measures hereinafter referred to in this Chapter. [Mr. Pasvolsky\nleft the meeting at this point.] Mr. Stassen said he thought that the\nexperts had better confer on this matter and readvise the Delegates\nwith regard to the interpretation of paragraph 1 and any possible\nrevision that should be proposed or supported.\n  Mr. Dulles said that measures of pacific settlement would already\nhave been attempted, and when those had failed, the dispute would\ncome under the provisions of Section B. He thought it right to say\nto the member states, "If you go to war, the Organization will impose\ndiplomatic and economic sanctions or call out the contingents of armed\nforces to bomb your cities." Senator Connally added that this was,\nhowever, wholly different from settling disputes. Mr. Dulles thought\nthat the measures referred to ought not to include that. There would\ncertainly be discrimination if the Security Council could impose set-\ntlements. It put too great a power in the Security Council, and it\nwas not fair to subject small countries to it. Mr. Stassen said he\nthought that the measures referred to in this paragraph involved alter-\nnative means of action if disputes were not settled on the recommenda-\ntions of the Organization or on some other basis. He did not think the\nSecurity Council could create substantive changes unless the disputants\nagreed, although they might be made to agree under pressure.\n  Mr. Notter said that in drafting the Proposals one theory had been\nfollowed. The International Organization is being created because\nthe nations want peace. It is not basically concerned with just settle-\nments. It says to the nations, "You cannot fight", and in Section\nA\nmany procedures are offered for settlement without the use of force.\nUnder Section A the Security Council has no right to recommend the\nterms of settlement. Under paragraph 1 of Section B, however, as\na very last resort to\'keep the peace the Security Council would have\nthe power to recommend terms of settlement in order to prevent a given\ndispute from continually threatening the peace of the world.
