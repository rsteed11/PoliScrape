General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1207\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nthought that this was an acceptable procedure and the Delegation\nagreed unanimously.\n  THE SECRETARY remarked that he would like to add a footnote\nto the discussion on voting procedure. The Secretary declared\nthat "the ball was now in our court" and it was up to the United\nStates to show leadership from that point on, and to throw its weight\naround. SENATOR CONNALLY declared that he intended to go beyond\nthe presentation of the Four Power Agreement.

The Secretary, declared that\nhe had given Senator Connally a copy of the Russian statement67\nexplaining the Russian agreement on the veto question.
