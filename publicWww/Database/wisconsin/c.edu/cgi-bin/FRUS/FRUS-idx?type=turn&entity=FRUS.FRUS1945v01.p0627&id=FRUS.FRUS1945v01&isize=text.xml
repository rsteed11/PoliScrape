STETrINIus and MR. EDEN indicated that this provision was\nacceptable to their respective Delegations.\n  MR. MOLOTOv asked for time to study the provision.\n  Paragraph 4. Recommendation of Terms of Settlemnent.-The pro-\nposal of the United Kingdom to add the following sentence to para-\ngraph 4 was taken up for consideration: "If the Security Council\ndeems that the continuance of the particular dispute is in fact likely\nto endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, it\nshall decide whether to take action under paragraph 5 or whether\nitself to recommend such terms of settlement as it may consider\nappropriate."\n  MR. EDEN said that his Government attached great importance to\nthis provision. He said that under the original provision if the Secu-\nrity Council took jurisdiction of a dispute its action was limited to the\nrecommendation of procedures or methods of settlement. He thought\nthat it would not be understood by the general public how the Council\ncould take up a dispute and then take no action looking towards its\nsettlement other than to recommend procedures or methods of\nsettlement.\n  DR. SOONG said that the provision was acceptable to his Delegation.\n  MR. MOLOTOV thought that the provision might be acceptable to his\nDelegation, but that they would like to go over the draft again.\n  MR. STETTINIUS said that it was the view of the United States Dele-\ngation that it was undesirable for the Security Council to have the\npower to recommend terms of settlement. He would be happy to dis-\ncuss the matter now or later as desired by the other Delegations.\n  MR. EDEN said that if this provision were not made clear by the\nproposed addition the Security Council could do nothing but talk\nand would not be in a position to take any effective action. At the\nvery least he thought it must have the power to make recommenda-\ntions as to terms of settlement.\n  The United States reserved its position on this question.\n  Paragraph 7. Domestic Jurisdiction.-Two proposals were before\nthe meeting with respect to this paragraph. The United States pro-\nposal was to delete the words "by international law" and the word\n"solely".\n  The British proposal was that paragraph 7 be replaced by the fol-\nlowing provision:\n  "(1) The Charter should not confer the right on any member of\nthe United Nations to require that a dispute or situation arising out\nof matters which by International Law are solely within the domestic\njurisdiction of the State concerned should be submitted to the means\nof settlement mentioned in Section A (3). Should, however, such a\nsituation or dispute constitute a threat to the maintenance of inter-\nnational peace or security, or should a breach of the peace occur in\nconsequence of such a situation or dispute, it should be open to the\n565\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0627&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0627&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0627&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0627&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0627&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0627&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0627&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0626&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0628&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0626&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0628&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0627&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
