Whereas the occupation of Germany could be Justified, that of\nFrance would meet with enormous difficulty.\n  SIR CHARLES PORTAL said there was, of course, no question of oc-\ncupying France.\n  ADMIRAL KING said that he felt it would be easier for the United\nStates to occupy the southwest zone if it could be arranged that the\nevacuation of American troops and supplies for the occupational\ntroops could be undertaken through north German ports.\n  THE COMBINED CHIEFS OF STAFF :\n  a. Agreed that the question of zones of occupation in Germany had\nsuch serious political implications that they were unable to make any\nrecommendation without guidance from their respective governments.\n  b. Decided to report in this sense to the President and Prime Min-\nister and, in doing so, to invite their attention to the need for an early\ndecision on this matter.\n      10. CONTROL OF STRATEGIC BOMBER FORCES IN EUROPE\n                          (C.C.S. 520/3 8)\n  GENERAL ARNOLD, during consideration of the British memorandum\nin C.C.S. 520/3, asked why the present method of control was stated\nto be unsatisfactory as a long-term arrangement.\n  SIR CIARLES PORTAL explained that in the opening stages of OvER-\nLORD the present system of control had been necessary and effective.\nHowever, with the move of General Eisenhower and Air Chief Mar-\nshal Tedder to France, they were divorced from General Spaatz\' head-\nquarters and from the Air Ministry, and strategic control by General\nEisenhower became almost a formality. Air Marshal Tedder had only\na small air staff and the large staffs of the Air Ministry, Bomber Com-\nmand and the U.S. Strategic Air Force in Europe had, of necessity,\nto exercise control over the actual strategic bombing operations.\n  8 "Control of Strategic Bomber Forces in Europe", September 13,\n1944; not\nprinted. Portal summarized the principal points in this memorandum during\nthe\ndiscussion recorded here. Cf. Ehrman, p. 513; Webster and Frankland, pp.\n57-60.\nFor a possible explanation of the British desire to change the control of\nthe\nstrategic bomber forces which did not come out in the discussion, see Craven\nand Cate, pp. 320-321.\n  At some time on September 11 or 12, before this meeting, Arnold had had\na\ndiscussion with Portal which is summarized as follows in Arnold, p. 524:\n       Portal and I had a session in which he asked for more C-54\'s-two per\nmonth-to put on a run between Ceylon and Australia. He wanted the command\nof the Strategic Air Forces changed to provide for a Committee of the R.A.F.\nand A.A.F., operating under Portal and Arnold for the Combined Chiefs of\nStaff;\nhe also wanted a British commanding officer for the American forces under\nMountbatten; and he wanted Lancasters to operate against Japan. He said the\nnew Lancasters had had additional tanks put on them which would give them\na\nmuch longer range and would make the missions possible. Since most of these\nitems would influence, or interfere with, our global operations, I could\nnot agree\nto any of them at that time, but said I would talk them over with my fellow\nJoint Chiefs of Staff members."\n309\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0369&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0369&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0369&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0369&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0369&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0369&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0369&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0368&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0370&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0368&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0370&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0369&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
