To refer Norway's proposal with respect to the role of the\nCouncil in the election of court judges to Committee IV/1.\n  e. To take the position that Uruguay's recommendation relating\nto government monopoly of arms production is unsuitable for incor-\nporation in the Charter.\n  Chapter VI, Section C\n  a. To oppose Norway's proposal requiring a vote of 8, instead of 7,\non Section C-3 matters.\n  b. To oppose the Netherlands proposal requiring a majority vote\nof non-permanent members in connection with Section C-3.\n  c. To oppose all other proposed amendments to Section C as defi-\nnitely beyond practical limits.\n  Chapter VI, Section D\n  a. To oppose Brazil's proposal requiring quarterly and extraordi-\nnary sessions of the Council-as not taking into account the conception\nthat the Council is in continuous session.\n  b. To regard Norway's argument that regional military collabora-\ntion must be defined by the agreement(s) under VIII-B-5 as a\nmatter for discussion in III/3.\n  c. To oppose the Mexican and Venezuelan proposals for determining\nwhen a member or non-member shall be called in by the Security\nCouncil.\n  d. To oppose the disqualification of any member of the Security\nCouncil involved in a dispute from participating in the taking of\ndecisions, as proposed by Liberia and Guatemala.\n  10. Action of the Delegation with respect to amendments pending-\nin connection with VIII-A 89 was as follows:\n  a. With respect to the authority of the Security Council to recom-,\nmend terms of settlement, it was agreed that the only question re-\nmaining was one of drafting. It was decided to oppose any amend-\nments which would give to the Security Council the power to impose,\nrather than recommend, terms of settlement.\n  b. With respect to the question whether the Security Council should\nbe obligated to submit justiciable questions to the Court, it was decided\nthat the Delegation would stand on the present wording of paragraph\n6. In case of a conflict between Committees 111/2 and IV//, a, joint\nsubcommittee would be appropriate.\n  c. With regard to the power of the General Assembly (or other\ninternational organ) to request an advisory opinion from the Court,\nit was decided to pass the matter over, since this question will not be\nreached in Committee III/2 for several days.\n  d. It was decided to oppose the removal to VIII-A of paragraphs\n1 and 2 of VIII-B, relating to the determination of threats to or\nbreaches of the peace, or acts of aggression, because this would con-\nstitute a change in the Yalta formula. It was decided that the Dele--\ngate of the United States in Committee III/2 take the view that III/2\nhas no competence until III/3 has acted, and that the amendment\nbe opposed in the latter Committee.\n  e. It was decided that any amendments providing for participation\nby the Assembly in pacific settlement should be opposed on the ground.\n  S9 Doc. 207, I11/2/A/3, May 10, UNCIO Documents, vol. 12, pp. 179, ff.\n773-\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0835&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0835&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0835&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0835&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0835&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0835&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0835&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0834&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0836&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0834&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0836&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0835&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
