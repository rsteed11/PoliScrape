A choice had to be made between selecting 15 or 16 or-\nganizations from among the chief pressure groups, veterans organiza-\ntions, farmers, etc., or selecting a larger group of organizations, some\n30 to 35, that would include, in addition to the larger pressure groups,\nwomen's organizations, religious groups and educational organizations\nthat were greatly interested in San Francisco. It had been agreed\nthat the larger number of organizations should be chosen and that\nrepresentatives should be invited from about 33 different agencies.\n  THE SECRETARY commented that this decision had been a difficult one\nto reach and that it had been hard to draw the line. However, the\ndelegates had had in mind the President's feeling that it was best in\nthe end to invite representatives from certain groups and establish a\nliaison office for them.\n  Tim SECRETARY then suggested that the meeting of the advisers and\ndelegates stand adjourned.\n  (The advisers then left the Secretary's Office.)\n  THE SECRETARY reconvened the meeting of the delegates and asked\nMr. Hiss to give an explanation of the documentation presented to\nthe delegates.\n  MR. HISS noted that the main purpose of the documents was to give\nthe delegates an opportunity to study the suggestions for changes\nin the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals that had been made by other gov-\nernments and that had emerged in the course of discussions in the\nUnited States. It was hoped, he said, that in the course of our dis-\ncussions we would make up our minds as to our attitude toward these\nproposed changes before going to the Conference.\n  THE SECRETARY said it was going to be necessary to cut through\nall the underbrush so that we would know exactly what proposals the\nAmerican delegation would stand by and favor and so that the matter\nwould be altogether clear. SENATOR VANDENBERG thought this was\na wise procedure.\n  MR. Hiss then explained that the text of the Dumbarton Oaks Pro-\nposals was printed on the white paper, comments by other govern-\nments on green paper and suggestions that emerged from discussions\nin the United States on pink paper in order to make each set of papers\nstand out clearly.\n  THE SECRETARY asked if this material had been digested to the min-\nimum. MR. Hiss replied in the affirmative.\n                      CONFERENCE POLICIES\n  THE SECRETARY asked Mr. Hiss to make a brief statement concerning\nthe problem of language at the Conference. MR.
