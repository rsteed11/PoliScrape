General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 184\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nbe named. We [THE SECRETARY] replied that we felt that the eighth\nparagraph of the statement made that matter entirely clear.\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON raised the question of the status of the\nSoviet republics and it was explained by MR. DUNN that by a change\nin the Soviet constitution last year they had been given certain au-\ntonomy relative to the conduct of foreign and military affairs.76 He\nindicated that they both now conducted foreign relations directly with\nthe so-called Lublin Polish Government.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG inquired if this did not raise the question\nof sovereign equality. THE SECRETARY replied that it was clear that\nwe had made a commitment to support this proposal if the Soviets\nraised it. MR. Hiss amplified this statement to the effect that we are\nnot committed on the question of sovereign equality but that we are\ncommitted that the admission of these two republics would not vio-\nlate sovereign equality. MR. STETTINrUs explained that he was not\npresent when the President informed the delegates of this situation 77\nand had not read a record of it. He added that he felt that if an\nindividual delegate did not feel free to support the commitment that\nthey should feel perfectly free to discuss it with the President.\n  REPRESENTATIVE EATON read the last two sentences of the second\nparagraph on page 2 and asked for an interpretation of the meaning\nthereof. THE SECRETARY replied that we felt it was a great mistake\nto ask for three votes for one country as that would violate sovereign\nequality. THE REPRESENTATIVE commented that the votes of the two\nrepublics in question would certainly be Soviet votes whereas the\nsame situation did not apply in the case of the constituent parts of\nthe British Empire. JUDGE HACKWORTH pointed out that the question\nof three votes in the assembly really is not a major matter as the\nassembly is not the action body of the organization. SENATOR\nVANDENBERG commented that while this might be true it would have\na very adverse effect on American public opinion.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY stressed that the final decision on this question\nis up to the Conference and he personally felt the Soviets would have\ndifficulty with the smaller states in having the proposal accepted.\n  DEAN GILDERSLEEVE inquired how the Delegation would vote at\nthe Conference and in reply was informed that the American Dele-\ngation would cast one vote after determining its position on a given\nmatter itself where presumably majority opinion would prevail.\n  In reply to SENATOR VANDENBERG'S request for a final answer TV.\nSECRETARY stated that we have a commitment to support the Soviet\nproposal if made, and repeated if any member individually does not\nagree with it he should take up the question with the President.
