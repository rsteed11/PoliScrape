PREPARAlTORY C;OMMISiSION\nTUSSR was also present. Massigli was absent because of his return\nto Paris today. Meeting was result of my private arrangement with\nGromyko.\n  Discussion covered SyG, non-permanent members of SC and mem-\nbers of EcoSoC with brief reference to presidency of GA.\n  With regard to SyG I mentioned a number of names which had\ncome to my attention during the PreCo to wit: Spaak, Van Royen,\nSir John Anderson, Aghnides, Mudaliar, Bruce, Pear-on, Monnet,\nVan Kleffens and finally Simic who had been suggested to me by\nGromyko. I explained that these were merely names with respect to\n-which only Spaak and Van Royen had received any formal and ap-\nproving consideration by my Government.\n  The question arose as to whether we should proceed with a discus-\nsion of names or principles. Koo suggested that we should first\ndetermine whether a US citizen was excluded, second, whether a\nNorth American could be considered and, third, whether one of the\ngreat powers could be considered.\n  Gromyko suggested that it should not be a North American. Web-\nster indicated that no one should be excluded and that the sole criterion\nshould be the best man. In response to Gromyko\'s inquiry about\nSimic, Webster said he was not sufficiently experienced and could not\nin his judgement compare with Spaak on grounds of competence, ex-\nperience or favorable reaction among others. Gromyko did not press\nhard on Simic and I think he was following instructions with full\nrealization of the futility but with the expectation that his bargaining\nposition would be improved. Webster indicated that his Govt\'s\nfirst choice was still General Eisenhower in spite of the fact that he\nwas from the US. Gromyko asked if he had second and third choices\nto which he did not respond. Koo indicated that his preference- on\nthe ground of the principles which he felt should prevail were Spaak,\nPearson, Masaryk and Van Kleffens. He felt that first the general\nprinciples should be established and then the possible candidates\neliminated by comparison with these principles.\n  Gromyko expressed agreement in principle with this position. I\nsuggested that perhaps we could approach the problem obliquely by\nfinding out if there were any other Big Five candidates except Eisen-\nhower. There were no names suggested except Tsing of China for-\nmerly Ambassador to Moscow who was suggested casually by Webster.\nI was requested by Webster to determine definitely if Eisenhower\nwould be available and agreed to do so.65 If he were eliminated there\n65 In telegram 11124, Preco 452, December 29, 3 p. m., to London, the Depart-\nment stated that "Webster\'s inquiry . . . has been informally referred\nto the\nWar Department. In response it has been suggested that you endeavor in-\nformally to discourage further proposal of General Eisenhower\'s name for\nthe\npost of Secretary General" (500.C0 (PC) /12-2945)\n1507\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0009.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0009.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1569&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1569&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1569&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1569&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1569&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1569&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1569&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0009.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0008&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0010&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1495&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1568&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1570&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0009.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0008&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0010&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1495&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1568&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1570&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1569&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
