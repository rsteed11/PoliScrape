United States participation in civil affairs in southern and\nsoutheast Europe will be limited to procurement and. shipment of\nsupplies to Albania, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and to the employment\nof a small number of officers in connection with distribution until such\ntime as U.N.R.R.A. can take over these duties."\n  These paragraphs were incorporated into the British directive to\nGeneral Wilson and it was sent to him on June 9.T \'The problems with\nrespect to Austria and the Balkans which seemed to have been so\nquickly solved was [were] suddenly confused, however, by twin in-\nquiries from the Foreitgn Office and the British Chiefs of Staff request-\ning clarificotion of our position. The British commented tflat the\nJune 9 directive to General Wilson stated that we would not occupy\nAustria, whereas on May 31 Ambassador Winant had informed the\nEuropean Advisory Commission that "he was authorized to accept\nthe proposal for the tripartite occupation of Austria." 4 The State\nDepartment was taken by surprise and telegraphed Winant on\nJune 15 5 that, so far as it knew, our policy on Austria had not\nchanged; we still believed that "Austria should be occupied by British\nforces." &#223;\n  Mr. Winant replied two days later. He explained that, although\nRussia and Great Britain had agreed on tripartite occupation of\nAustria, he had had no instructions on the subject. "On the last day\nI was in Washington [May 26]," he wrote, "I accordingly took this\nmatter up with the President and obtained his permission to agree to\nthe tripartite control of Austria on the understanding that I would\nin no way commit us respecting the size of the contingent that we\nmight be willing to contribute for this occupation. In working on the\ndrafts concerning the subject of occupation of Austria, I rejected, for\nexample, the phrase \'will be occupied by the forces of three countries\'\nand have used the less concise phrase \'tripartite control.\' When\nGeneral Marshall was here I discussed this question with him and\nexplained our limited position." 11\n  Ambassador Winant\'s belated account of his discussion with the\nPresident clarified the situation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff informed\nthe British Chiefs on 12 July, in answer to their query, that "there\nis no change in the policy of the United States Government as regards\noccupational forces for Austria except that a token force similar to the\n  $C.C.S. 320/18, 11 June 1944.
