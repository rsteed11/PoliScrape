AmrendmnWntV: Conference for Review of Charter\n  Stating that he understood this question was a very important one\nin the minds of certain other countries, MI. STmTiNIuS said he hoped\nthe five could agree on a common position today. In replying to his\ninquiry, the other four heads of delegations said they had no further\ncomments. Mr. Stettinius reminded them that at the previous\nmeeting of the five they had expressed somewhat different views; it\nis important to reach one position which we can all agree on. What\nprocedure should we use for this purpose since the subcommittee of\nthe five has now adjourned ?\n  DR. PASVOLSKY stated that the issues are clear. He doubted that\nit is a matter of drafting but considered that a political decision at\nthe high level is necessary, both on the question as to whether the vote\nin the Assembly shall be two-thirds or three-fourths and as to whether\nanything should be said about the right of a state to withdraw in\ncase it finds itself unable to accept an amendment to the Charter.\n  LORD HALIFAX said that as he saw it there were three issues: (1)\nwhether any time for the holding of a Conference should be men-\ntioned; (2) whether there should be three-fourths or two-thirds vote\nin the Assembly; and (3) the right of a state to withdraw in the\nevent of unpalatable amendments. With respect to the last, MR.\nPASVOLSKY interjected that there is no question of writing any right\nto withdraw into the Charter; it is merely whether or not there should\nbe written into the record the interpretation that that right would\nexist.\n  LORD HALIFAX suggested that we take his three points one by one.\nAs to the first, the U.K. Delegation favored language permitting a\nConference to be called at any time after 7 or (10) years. MR. PAS-\nvOLsKY said that the U.S. position is that the Conference should be\nheld not less than 7 nor more than 10 years after the Organization is\nstarted. After MR. ARMSTRONG had remarked that the members of the\ntechnical committee 33 would probably regard Lord Halifax's suggest!\ntion as more restrictive than the present language, rather than less so,\nthe BRiISH AMBASSADOR said that he preferred his suggestion but did\nnot feel too strongly on the matter and could see the force of Mr. Arm-\nstrong's argument. AMBASSADoR GROMYXO preferred to stand by the\ntext of the four-power amendment.\n  DR.
