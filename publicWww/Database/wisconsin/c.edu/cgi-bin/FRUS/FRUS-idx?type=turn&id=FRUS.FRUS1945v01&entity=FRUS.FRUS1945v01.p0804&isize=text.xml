General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 742\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1,945, VOLUME I\nBloom had brought this problem before the Delegation in the morn-\ning meeting-3 preceding the session of the Committee where it was\nto be taken up, but that the Delegates had not realized its importance.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLooM said that when you are in a meeting you\nfeel that you must win if you possibly can. You cannot always ask\ninstructions and if you cannot get instructions you have to do your\nbest. MR. SANDIFER read the following items from the Agenda for\nthe Fifth Meeting of Committee II/l [Document 294, II/1/10,\nMay 14,1945.]:\n  "A. Should the Secretary General be elected by the Assembly-\n      3. Upon nomination by. a simple majority of the members, of\n    the Security Council.\n      5. On recommendation of the Security Council for a period of\n    ;three years, the Secretary General to be~eligible for re-election."\n  REPRESENTAIVE BLoOM said that the Committee had voted that\nnomination by the Security Council should be made by a vote-of\nseven members. This was a compromise proposition. MR. SANDIVER\nsaid that under the Yalta formula seven votes in the Security Council\nwould have to include the five permanent members. REPRESENTATIVE\nBBLooM said that the proposition in this form could never have gotten\nthrough the Committee. It was not unlikely, even, that in that case\nthe Committee would have voted that the Secretary General should\nbe elected by General Assembly, alone, without participation by the\nSecurity Council. He said it was recognized in the Committee that\nCommittee I/2 was dealing with the chapter on the Secretariat,34\nand that this motion constituted a recommendation to that Committee.\n  Mn?. NOTTER said that there was a real problem here. The four\npowers had agreed on a certain procedure, and then the United States\nDelegate had taken a different line and the others did not like it. We\nhave to decide whether or not we are going to stand by the other three\non the position that voting in the Security Council must include the\npermanent members. REPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said that they never\nwould have gotten their proposal through this Committee. DEAN\nGILDERSLEVE said she had considerable sympathy with Mr. Bloom\'s\nposition. She found it very difficult always to stick to the four-\npower agreements in the face of developments in committee meetings.\nREPRESENTATIVE BLOOM said that the opposition on the subject of the\nDeputies proved that if the four power amendment had been put to\na vote without any compromise, it would have been lost.\n33 For minutes of the thirty-eighth meeting, May 14, 9: 05 a. m., see p.\n707.\n34 See agenda for sixth meeting of Committee I/2, Doc. 249, 1/2/13, May 12,\nIJNCIO Documents, vol. 7, p. 35;
