I stated that the\ntext of the invitations would be that contained in the Department's\n406, February 23, midnight, unless we were advised before noon,\nMarch 4, of the willingness of the French Provisional Government to\njoin as a sponsoring nation as a result of conversations which I under-\nstood were proceeding between the Soviet and French Governments on\nthe matter.\n  In reply I received this morning a note from Molotov dated March 5\nstating that the Soviet Government continued to support the form\nof invitation which was worked out in the Crimea Conference as\ndescribed in my letter and that it had no objection to the date of\nissuance.\n  Molotov continued that no special conversations had been carried\non between the Soviet and French Governments on this matter, al-\nthough the following had taken place:\n  General Catroux had called on Dekanozov 15 last evening and had\nbeen informed of the Soviet position with respect to the amendment to\nthe second paragraph of the invitation as proposed by' the French\nGovernment.

Although Dekanozov could not give a final answer to this\nrequest, Molotov stated in his letter that there were no objections\non the part of the Soviet Government if the United States and British\nGovernments should agree to postpone the date of issuance and release\nof the invitations one or two days.\n  Upon the receipt of the Department's 497, March 4, 4: 00 p. m.,'6\nI informed Molotov this morning that we were proceeding to release\nand issue the invitations today at 12 noon and stated that my Govern-\nment assumed that the Soviet Government would simultaneously\nrelease the text in Moscow.
