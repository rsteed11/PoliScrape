General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1023\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\na few days Ambassador Gromyko would present Russian positions on\nthe outstanding questions. However, THE SECRETARY declared, first\nthe United States\' position must be established onl these matters, and\nhe pointed out that Monday would be June 4th and that the next week\nwould have to be the last week of real work if the Conference were\nnot to bog down completely. THE SECRETARY hoped that he could\nhold a meeting of the Big Five that afternoon, and he stated that it\nwas essential that the Big Five make up their minds quickly on the\namendments which they were willing to accept.\n  THE SECRETARY urged that the Delegation ignore the agenda for\nthe time-being and "cut through the underbrush". He then asked\nwhether Mr. Pasvolsky would outline for the Delegation those items\non which decisions had not been reached. THE SECRETARY pointed\nout that until the Delegation fixed the position on these questions\nwhich were pending he, himself, would not be in any position to\nthrow his weight around in attempting to bring pressure on the other\nmembers of the Big Five to establish their positions quickly.\n                        QUESTIONS PENDING\n  MR. PASVOLSKEcy declared the most important item facing the Dele-\ngation was the French regional question, Chapter VIII, Section C,\nParagraph 2. The question of amending procedure had been decided\npreviously by the Delegation as had the procedure for the election\n(f judges to the World Court and for the election of the Secretary-\nGeneral. THE SECRETARY asked what position had been reached by\nthe Delegation with respect to the Deputy Secretaries-General. MR.\nPASVOLSKY indicated that he thought the Delegation had wanted him\nto maintain a negotiating position. The Delegation had favored try-\ning to obtain approval for the proposal which he had submitted in\nthe previous day\'s meeting  and if it proved impossible to obtain\napproval of this suggestion the Delegation favored going along with\nthe Russian position.\n   MR. PASVOLSKY remarked that the question of supply of forces had\n been almost completely resolved satisfactorily. However, there was\n one matter which was still before the Big Five and that was the Rus-\n sian opposition to the inclusion of any reference to "right of passage"\n in Chapter VIII, Section B, Paragraph 5.13\n                   TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\n   MR. PASVOLSKY presented to the Delegation a draft of Chapter XII,\n Transitional Arrangements. MR. PASVOLSiKY declared that there had\n   1 See minutes of the 59th meeting of the United States delegation, May\n31,\n   p. 989.
