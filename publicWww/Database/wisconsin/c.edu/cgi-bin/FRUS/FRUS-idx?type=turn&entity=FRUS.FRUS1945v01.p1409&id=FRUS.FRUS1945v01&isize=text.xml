General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1347\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nnecessary and the original provision had been deleted. REPRESENTA-\nTIVE BLOOM thought. that it had been decided in the- Penthouse to\n,etain the original Dumbarton Oaks Proposal. The recent Four\nPower decision had been concerned only with the matter of the Deputy\nSecretaries General. The matter of the Secretary 43eneral-had been\nleft as originally decided in the Four Power amendment. MR. NoTwR\nremarked that the Russians would probably raise this question again.\nREPRESENTATivE BLOOM asked whether the Delegation' would suggest\nthat Committee II/1 accept the new language.\n  MR. ARKSTRONG declared that he would like to explain some of the\narguments which had been proposed. It had been urged that, if no\nterm of office were set for the Secretary General, a good man could\nbe maintained in office indefinitely. The establishment of a short\nterm of office would mean political bargains and Mr. Armstrong\nthought that the new proposal was superior, administratively speak-\ning. The Russians were in favor of an even shorter term than had\noriginally been supported and were; desirous of establishing a oneo\nyear tenure. They had opposed the, deletion of the three-year term\nbut it had been decided that it would'be best to have no term whatso-\never. S1NATORJ CONNALLY agreed with the point made previously\nthat there would be a great deal of political trading at each election\nif a sh6rt tenure were established. MR. STONE agreed that the pro-\ncedure-should be left flexible. It was possible, he said, to get rid of\nan unsuccessful Secretary General without fixing a definite period of\ntenure. SENATOR CONNALLY thought that Commander Stassen had\nthought that this new decision would violate a Five Power agreement.\nHowever, SENATOR CONNALLY reported that he could n6t remember\nany such agreement. MR. NODDER thought that the Delegation had\ntaken the right action withr respect to -the substance of the proposal.\nHowever, Ambassador Koo had been confused about the character of\nthe arrangemnents among the sponsoring governments. REPRESENTA-\nTivE BLOOM - thought that the representatives of the Delegation had\nbeen instructed to take the old position. MR. NOTTER urged that if\nthe Russians did not raise the question there would be no difficulty.\nMR. SANDIFER agreed but added that if the Russians reopened the\nquestion the 'Delegation could not maintain the new position without\nfirst consulting the U.S.S.R. MR. ARMSTROiG declared that there\nhad been a most unusual situation. Both the Chinese and Byelorus-\nsian Delegations had voted with the -United States. Mn. NOTmnR\nthought that the solution was very satisfactory inasmuch as the Rus-\nsian Delegate had had ample opportunity to be heard. REPRENTA-\naIVE' BLoOM proteted that he had been placed in a very embarrassing\nposition. At first he had declared the decision, of the TDelegation was\n1347\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1409&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1409&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1409&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1409&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1409&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1409&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1409&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1408&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1410&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1408&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1410&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1409&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>"
