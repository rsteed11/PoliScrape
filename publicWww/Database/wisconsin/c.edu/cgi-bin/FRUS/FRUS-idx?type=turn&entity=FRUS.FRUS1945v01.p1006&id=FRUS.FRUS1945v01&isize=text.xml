MR. HICKERSON\ndeclared that he would try to get a postponement on this question.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY, who was in the chair because the Secretary had\nhad to leave the meeting, asked whether the Delegation wished to ex--\npress its opinion on the question at issue. SENATOR VANDENBERG pro-\nposed a formal motion that the Delegation support phraseology which:\nwould permit the Council to be a party to the agreements for the sup--\nply of forces to the Organization. The Delegation unanimously ac-\ncepted this motion. MR. PASVOLSKY emphasized that the wording\nsuggested would leave the matter open and would merely make par--\nticipation of the Council in these agreements possible.\n  MR.- HIcKERsoN remarked that he had promised the IRussian dele-\ngates that the United States would not vote for the Australian amend--\nment. SENATOR CONNALLY declared that he would try to postpone\nthe question, but\'if he were maneuvered into casting a vote he would\nvote according to the Delegation\'s wishes as expressed in their de-\ncisions of a few meetings earlier. This, he declared, was a realistic\nsituation. The Security Council had the actual authority to make\nwar and take other important steps. It was foolish, he said, to leave\nit to the states to take the initiative in supplying forces to the\nOrganization.\n  MR. PASVOLSKY suggested that Senator Connally try to leave the\nsituation flexible. It was necessary, he declared, to reach an under-\nstanding with the other four powers. MR. PASVOLSKY urged that Sen-\nator Connally attempt to work out some arrangement at the meeting.\nMR. HICKERSON observed that the Russians appeared to be in opposi-\ntion to the Australian amendment while the British favored it. He\nhad not spoken with the Chinese representatives on this matter.\n  SENATOR CONNALLY declared that he would accept the wording "by\nthem with the approval of the Security Council." MR. PASVOLSKKY\nasked why Senator Connally would not stand on the more advanced\nposition which the Delegation had taken. MR. JOHNSON suggested\nthat, if necessary, the solution might be to delete the words "concluded\namong themselves," but MR. PASVOLSKY replied that it would be im-\npossible to achieve acceptance for this change. MNIP. ARMSTRONG\nasked what was the real reason for the Russian opposition to the Aus-\ntralian amendment, and MR. HICKERSON replied that he was unable to\nanswer that question. SENATOR CONNALLY declared that the opposi-\ntion was derived from the unwillingness of a number of "little old\ncountries" to supply troops to the Organization. MR. HTICKERSON re-\nplied, however, that Russia could hardly be called a "little old coun--\ntry." MR. PASVOLsKY reiterated that the Chinese opposition was based\non legal grounds, and REPRESENTATIVE EATON interpolated that the\nopposition of the U.S.S.R. was based on Russian grounds. MR.
