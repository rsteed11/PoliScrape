PREPARATORY COMMISSION\nassure you, to serve any ulterior motive, but because the US delegation\nbelieves that secrecy is a bad precedent for the United Nations; be-\ncause we feel that our decisions in so far as possible should in all cases\nand on all issues now and hereafter be made not secretly but openly.\nAs Mr. Noel-Baker said the other day, we have spoken frankly on\nthis issue. We feel that we should vote openly and frankly in the\nsame spirit. I am happy that in its infancy the United Nations has\nnot adopted the methods of secrecy.'&gt;\n  Agreement had been reached during the day between both sides on\na procedure by which there would have been a ballot either open or\nsecret in which each member would name the country of his choice\nfor the permanent headquarters, either the US or some European\ncountry. The European country which received the greatest number\nof votes would then have been proposed as an amendment to Recom-\nmendation No. 1 and voted on. Then the recommendation itself\nwould have been brought to a vote. Agreement had not been reached,\nhowever, on whether these votes should be by secret or open ballot.\nAfter the Committee voted down the secret ballot, New Zealand, sup-\nported by the UK, Canada and others, opposed proceeding further\nalong the lines that had been agreed upon on the grounds that secrecy\nhad been an integral part of this procedure. A move for adjournment\nwas also opposed.\n  Wilgress of Canada made and then withdrew a motion to recon-\nsider the Canadian voting proposal and moved an immediate vote\non Recommendation No. 1. Hoo of China called for a vote first on\namendment to the recommendation substituting Europe for the US\nsince the substance of such an amendment had been advocated by\nmost of those opposing the recommendation. The chairman pointed\nout that no amendment for Europe had been offered in spite of his\nrepeated requests for such an amendment. Noel-Baker supported\nWilgress and denied that the UK had indulged in delaying tactics,\nor had any ulterior motives.\n  Manuilsky of the Ukraine declared a, most painful impression\nwas being created by the attempt of those in favor of Europe to\navoid the regular procedure which should have been to embody their\nconvictions in an amendment for Europe which would then be put\nto a vote. If the amendment were defeated the Committee would\nthen vote on the recommendation itself. That was the orderly and\nregular way to proceed.\n  Gromyko supported Manuilsky and suggested that, since the sup-\nporters of Europe refused to offer an amendment, the chairman or\nsome other delegate who had not yet committed himself in the debate\nshould offer it. The chairman then declared that Uruguay would\nmove an anendmeint in favor of Europe.
