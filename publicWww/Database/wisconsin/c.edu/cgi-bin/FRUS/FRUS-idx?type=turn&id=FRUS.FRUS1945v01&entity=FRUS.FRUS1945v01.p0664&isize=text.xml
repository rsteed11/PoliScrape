General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 602\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 19 4 5,i VOLUME I\nprevious evening, the British Delegation had presented its paper 97\nand in view of the many differences of position between the United\nStates proposal and the British proposal, the other three Governments\n(Soviet Union, China and France) had reserved their position on both\npapers in order to allow for further time for study.\n  MR. STASSEN said that he recommended that the Five-Power con-\nsultations continue but that they would take several days. In order\nto avoid holding up the Conference action on this matter, however,\nhe suggested that if it were agreeable to the other three Governments,\neach of the four sponsoring Governments should be free to submit an\namendment to the Charter covering its views of the trusteeship ques-\ntion and then to continue the consultations while the Conference was\nin session. He said that if such a course were not pursued, he feared\nthat there would be a general feeling in the Conference that the spon-\nsoring Governments were "holding out" on the Conference.\n  MR. EDEN indicated his agreement with Mr. Stassen\'s suggestion.\n  MR. STASSEN pointed out that his suggestion would not in any way\npreclude any of the five Powers at any stage of the consultation from\nadvancing proposals or counter-proposals to each of the original\nproposals.\n  MR. MoLoTov said that he was in agreement with Mr. Stassen\'s pro-\nposal and MEssRs. EDEN and SooNG also said that they agreed. MR.\nSTASSEN said that, for the information of the group, the Freohch Dele-\ngation had also agreed to follow this course of action.\n  AIR. STErNrus said that this completed their agenda for this noon\nsession, except for the proposed press statement. He said, however,\nthat several items still remained unsettled and for that reason he pro-\nposed an early meeting in the evening at six o\'clock for the purpose\nof finally concluding these consultations in order that the joint Four-\nPower amendments might be submitted to the Conference before the\nmidnight deadline.\n  In view of the situation, MR. PASVOLSKY suggested, and it was agreed,\nthat the Subcommittee on Treaties would meet at five o\'clock in the\nafternoon in room 512 for final consultations on the proposed amend-\nments dealing with regional arrangements.\n97Doc. 2, G/26(d), May 6, UNCIO Documents, vol. 3, p. 609.
