General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 977\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE\nmember of the United Nations could make any suggestion it chose.\nHowever, THE SECRETARY was of the opinion that preliminary dis-\ncussions among the Big Five would have the advantage of establish-\ning a Five-Power position.\n  MR. ROCKEFELLER urged that the Delegation establish a position in\nadvance, in case Italy were proposed for membership.76  It would\nbe easier, he said, to decide in advance than to establish a position\nduring the course of the meeting. MR. STEvENSON urged that if\nItaly were proposed, the United States could not possibly oppose its\nadmission to the Conference in view of the unfavorable reaction such\na position would provoke on the part of the American people. REP-\nRESENTATIVE BrooM agreed with Mr. Stevenson's remarks and declared\nthat Congress would react unfavorably to opposition by this Delega-\ntion to the extension of an invitation to Italy. REPRESENTATIVE BLOODS\ndeclared that if possible the Delegation did not want to raise any\nobstacles to approval of the Charter by the Senate. MR. HICKERSON\nwas of the opinion that no matter what decision were to be reached\nby the Big Five, the question of inviting Italy would be brought up\nonce the problem of inviting Denmark were brought before the Con-\nference. THE SECRETARY suggested that the Big Five should be\nbrought to agreement that the admission of Denmark should be de-\nlayed until the last possible moment. MR. HICKERSON remarked that\neven that would not solve the problem because the Italian question\nwould be raised at that time. THE SECRETARY asked whether politi-\ncally the United States could afford to accept an invitation to Italy.\n  AR. DTJLLEs asked whether someone could inform him what the\nlegal procedure would be for a state to become a signatory to the\nCharter after it had been ratified, and MR. JIACKWORTH replied that\na special procedure would have to be established. MR. HISS remarked\nthat this consideration did not apply with respect to Poland because\nPoland had been invited to the Conference initially but was not in\nattendance because of the fact that there was no recognized govern-\nment. MR. Hiss was of the opinion that the Conference would agree\nto leave a space in the protocol of ratification for Poland's signature.\nThe other nations, however, posed a different problem.\n  REPRESENTATIVE BLooM commented that he did not think Mr. Mor-\ngenstierne would act in opposition to a decision by the Big Five. My.\nROCKEFELLER urged that the United States declare, in a meeting of\nthe Big Five, that it would vote in favor of inviting Denmark. Then\nhe suggested that this Government propose five or six other states\nfor invitation at the last moment in order that they might become\noriginal signatories to the Charter. THE SECRETARY declared that in\nhis opinion it would be impossible to adopt this procedure.
