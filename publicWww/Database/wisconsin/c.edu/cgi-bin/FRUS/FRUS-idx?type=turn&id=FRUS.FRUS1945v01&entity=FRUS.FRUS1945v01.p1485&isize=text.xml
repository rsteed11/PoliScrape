The record of the Conference would show that the Eng-\nlish text had been adopted and for that reason the Soviet representa-\ntive had thought the English text should be accepted as the governing\ntext. MR. PASVOLSKY declared that this sounded reasonable to him.\nSENATOR CONNALLY declared that it was his understanding that the\nFrench text was not a translation but was a restatement in French\nof the ideas of the English text. MR. PASVOLSKY confirmed this and\ndeclared that each of the five drafts would be an authentic text.\n  MR. DULLES asked who would certify for the Delegations as to the\nnature of what they were signing. MR. PASVOLSKY declared that\nthree language panels had been established for this purpose.99 Each\nDelegation had the right to designate as its representative to these\npanels a person who knew the language involved. These panels went\nthrough the text completely, in Russian, Chinese and Spanish. A\ndifferent procedure had been adopted with respect to the French text\nwhich had been parallel with the English draft. The French text\nhad been gone over in the Coordination Committee and in the Com-\nmittee of Jurists. MR. SANDIFER reported that the United States had\nno representative on the Chinese panel but pointed out that the British\nhad a representative who was giving careful consideration to this\ntext. MR. DuLLAs wondered whether the Delegation would not want\ncertification from Mr. Bohlen or someone else who had a knowledge\nof the languages involved before the Delegates signed the Charter.\nMR. HACKWORTH declared that the three-language panels would cer-\ntify the documents. COMMANDER STASSEN declared that he was in\nagreement with Mr. Dulles that there should be final certification\nfor the record from either the language panels or someone in the\nState Department declaring that it was all right for the Delegation\nto sign the various language drafts. MR. HACEWORTH remarked\nthat consideration had been given in the Committee of Jurists to the\npossibility of signing only in one language.' However, the Com-\nmittee of Jurists had declared that this procedure was not acceptable\n'Doe.
