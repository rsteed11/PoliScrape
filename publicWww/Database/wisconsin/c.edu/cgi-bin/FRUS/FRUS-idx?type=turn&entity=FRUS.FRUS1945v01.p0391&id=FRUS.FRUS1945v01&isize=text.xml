The-Secretary said-that the Latin\nAmerican Republics had none either but that we were quite sure that\nthe U.S.S.R. was not prepared to agree.  He said wo had not yet\ndecided what to do. He had told Mr. Rockefeller to advise the South\nAmerican Ambassadors- with whom he was discussing this matter\nthat he, the Secretary, was preparedto take this matter up and dis-\ncuss it with the Foreign Ministers when they arrived here\'later this\nweek but that he was not prepared to request or propose favorable ac-\ntion.  He felt this would hold the situation only temporarily.  The\nSecretary said he thought recognition was one thing but acceptance as a\nUnited Nation was another. The United Nations had grouped to-\ngether to stop the enemy and now we should go slowly before per-\nmitting the-Argentine to join...\n  Mr. Eden said this was fundamentally a U. S. decision and that\nhe would support us in any decision we made but would not himself\npush the Argentine case. The question was asked as to whether the\nArgentine request involved the matter of an invitation to the Con-\nference. The Secretary stated that this had not arisen yet but we\ndid expect it in due course, and that if they became a United Nation\nduring the Conference, the matter might have to be put to a vote in\nthe Conference as to whether Argentina would be permitted a seat.\nMr. Eden seemed somewhat surprised at this and wondered what\nwould happen in that event.-\n  The Secretary called Mr. Rockefeller into the meeting -and he\nasked him- to explain to Mr. Eden the Argentine situation ?as he saw\nit.&lt; They had a private discussion of five or ten minutes.\n  [Here follow sections D through G concerning Holland, Austria,\nSweden, and prisoners of war.]\n                                      E[DWAW] S[rNrUS, Jr.]\n500.CC/4-145 Telegram\n  The Secretary of State to the Ambassador in the Soviet Union\n                            WASHINGTON, April 17, 1945-7 p. m.\n  898.
