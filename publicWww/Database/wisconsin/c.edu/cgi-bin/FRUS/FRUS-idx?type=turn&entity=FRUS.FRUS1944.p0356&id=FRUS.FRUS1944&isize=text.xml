A memorandum on the same meeting prepared by Assistant\nSecretary of War McCloy recorded: "Mr. Morgenthau said it was\nquite apparent that Mr. Churchill was violently opposed to the United\nStates making any Lend-Lease arrangements with France, and the\nPresident seemed to fall in with this." (Stimson Papers)\n  4. Cooperraton between the United States and the United Kingdonm\nin the field of atomic energy research. Although no memoranda have\nbeen found of conversations held at Quebec on this subject, the follow-\ning information is recorded in a memorandum of September 22, 1944\nby Vannevar Bush, Director of the Office of Scientific Research and\nDevelopmnent, concerning a meeting held at the White House that day:\n      "The President then started discussing the subject [atomic\n    energy] quite generally.... The President was very much in\n    favor of complete interchange with the British on this subject\n    after the war in all phases, and apparently on a basis where it\n    would be used jointly or not at all. lie told of some of his dis-\n    cusions with Mr. Churchill at Quebec along these lines. . . . The\n    President\'s own statements in regard to post-war collaboration\n    with Britain on the subject were very general indeed, but went\n    very far. He pointed out his belief of the necessity for maintain-\n    ing the British Empire strong, and went into some of the methods\n    by which this could be brought about, which are not pertinent to\n    this subject. As usual there were a number of other non-pertinent\n    matters such as statements in regard to the discussions at Quebec."\n    (A.E.C. Files, Tlistorical Document No. 185)\nIn a memorandum of September 23, 1944, Bush stated that Lord\nCherwell, who had been present at the meeting described above, "had\nmadle remarks which showed that he had been present at at least some"\nof the Roosevelt-Churchill conversations at Quebec on atomic energy.\n(A.E.C. Files, Historical Document No. 186)\n  5. Aid to the Warsaw resistance. For documentation originating at\nthe Quebec Conference on this subject, see post, pp. 396 WT. Eden, p. 552,\nrecords that "Poles" constituted one of the subjects of discussion\nbe-\ntween Roosevelt and Churchill at Quebec on September 14, 1944.\nAccoCrdingf to a Polish report of an Eden-MNikoTajczyk conversation\nheld at London on September 19, 1944, "Mr. Eden said further that at\nQuebec both Prime Mdinister Churchill and President Roosevelt had\nconsidered that the change in Stalin\'s position on the matter of assist-\nalce, to W7arsaw [see ante, pp. 202, 203] was a good omen; in their opin-\nion it was due to their own resolute stand against him on that matter."\'\n(Doecutments on Polish-Soviet Relations, p. 390) According to a Pol-\nish report of a Churchill-Mikolajczyk conversation held at London\non September 29, 1944, "Churchill explained that the question of fur-\nther support for Warsaw had been one of the items discussed by him\nwith President Roosevelt at Quebec and that it had eventually been\ndecided to do everything feasible so far as the Anglo-Saxon Powers\nwere concerned." (Ibid., p. 396)\n\'According to a record by Stettinilus of a conversation with Cadogan at Wash-\nington on September 116, 1944, "Cadogan stated that the Prime Minister\nhad\nbragged [at Quebec] about softening Uncle Joe on Poland."
