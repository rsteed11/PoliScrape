He agreed with the pro-\nviso that Admiral Willson be supplied with complete papers in case\nit was necessary for him to refer to them.7\n  I next took up with the President the question of an international\nair force.8 We had some little difficulty in explaining th is so that the\nPresident completely understood it.

During this conver-\nsation, Mr. I-lull got the incorrect impression that the President was\ntalking about Eden taking Cadogan\'s place in Washington while\nCadogan was in Quebec and objected violently to such a procedure.\nWe of course straightened this out. I suggested that I be authorized to\npress for Halifax taking Cadogan\'s chair if the latter should be called\naway. Both gave complete approval to this but wished me to make\nevery effort to persuade Cadogan not to leave the meeting....\n  I then raised with the President the importance of his having politi-\ncal advisers with him at meetings such as the forthcoming one at\nQuebec, in the event that political questions would be discussed.
