General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 1008\n\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS, 1945, VOLUME I\nall the signatories to the Charter, to consent under the latest language\nof Paragraph 2 of VIII, C. ADMIRAL HEPBURN replied that it would\nbe possible for the four major powers to be designated as having the\nresponsibility and hence their consent alone would be necessary under\nthe new language. SENATOR VANDENBERG asked whether, when the\nwording "by consent" had been agreed upon, it was meant that "every-\nbody" was signified. MR. PASVOLSKY replied that the meaning had\nbeen that any State with an interest in either of the two situations,\nresponsibility under-Chapter XII or regional agreements, would have\nbeen a party under the original language. MR. DUNN indicated that\nhe had been of the opinion that only the parties to regional agree-\nments were implied and that that was why he had favored the origi-\nnal language. MR. DULLES indicated. that it would be much easier, in\nhis opinion, to influence two parties to a regional arrangement to give\nup that arrangement. But MR. PAsvOrLsKy declared that the Security\nCouncil could not accept the responsibility despite the willingness of\nparties to a regional arrangement to relinquish their rights under that\nagreement. MR. DULLES asked whether he was correct in under-\nstanding Mr. Pasvolsky to have said that it would be impossible for\nthe parties to a regional arrangement to give up that arrangement\nwithout the consent of all the responsible parties under Chapter XII,\nParagraph 2. MR. PASVOLSKY declared that the parties to a regional\narrangement could relinquish that pact any time they so desired;\nhowever, the functions of supervising enemy states could be turned\nover to the Council only by the nations concerned with that super-\nvision during the interim period. These nations would be refined\nunder the surrender terms. MR. PASVOLSKY thought that a serious\nmistake had been made in not incorporating in Chapter XII specific\nprovision that the powers referred to should be turned over to the\nOrganization. MR. PASVOLSKY declared that if the exception estab-\nlished in paragraph 2 of VIII, C were not taken advantage of, the\nOrganization would have authority over preventing further aggres-\nsion by enemy states. However, this exception related, under the\npresent wording, to the two separate spheres, states responsible for\nsupervision of enemy territories and parties to regional arrangements.\n  MR. DUNN declared that he understood the distinction drawn be-\ntween the two areas; however, he thought that the parties to a re-\ngional arrangement could relinquish to the Security Council the\nfunctions provided for under the treaty, provided that the Security\nCouncil was willing to accept these functions, without the responsi-\nbilities involved in the sphere of supervision of enemy territories be-\ning relinquished. SENATOR VANDENBERG asked that Mr. Pasvolsky\nadmit that somebody in addition to Mr. Pasvolsky and Commander\nStassen should be able to understand the wording. MR. PASVOLSKY\n1008\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1070&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1070&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1070&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1070&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1070&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1070&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1070&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1069&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1071&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1945v01/reference/frus.frus1945v01.i0008.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0007&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.i0009&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p0063&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1069&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1071&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1945v01.p1070&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945v01&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
