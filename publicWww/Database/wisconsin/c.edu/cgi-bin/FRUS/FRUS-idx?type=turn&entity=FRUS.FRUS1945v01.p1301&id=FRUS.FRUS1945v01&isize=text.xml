HICKERSoN remarked that the decision the Delegation would\nbe called on to make that morning would not require any background\nmaterial. The only matter before the Delegation was a decision as\nto whether it should consider the Italian request. Mr. Hickerson\nreported to the Delegation that the Italian Ambassador had been in-\nformed that it would be necessary to obtain the concurrence of the\nother sponsoring governments for the issuance of any invitation. It\nhad been carefully explained to the Italian Ambassador that a real\nsetback to the advancement of the Italian cause might result if the\nmatter were to be considered prematurely and if the reaction were\nvery unfavorable. However, partly as a result of internal propa--\nganda within the United States, the question had been raised again\nand the Delegation considered the admission of Italy briefly on May\n29.94 At that time Mr. Dunn had been authorized to undertake care-\nful conversations with the other sponsoring governments with a view\nto sounding out the reception which might be tendered to a proposal\nto invite Italy to the Conference. Mr. Dunn had undertaken to carry\nout these conversations, and in line with the instructions of the Dele--\ngation, had approached the United Kingdom first on the matter, in\nview of their more immediate interest. Professor Webster had been\ncompletely uncommunicative and no answer whatsoever had been\nreceived. It had been decided as a result of this abortive attempt toa\nsound out the British that communications should be undertaken with\nthe State Department in Washington concerning the advisability of\nattempting to gain a position on this question from London. Thisa\nwas done and no answer had been received as yet.\n  On May 29, two notes 95 had been received by the Secretary, one in\nhis capacity as Chairman of the Delegation and one asking that he\ncirculate the memorandum in his capacity as President of the Con-\nference, from the Italian Ambassador in Washington. SECRETARY\nSTETrTINrus asked what action was taken with respect to these mes-\nsages. MR. HICOERSON replied that he and Mr. Dunn had talked over\nthe matter and had decided at that time to await the results of Mr.\nDunn's attempt to discover the attitude of the other sponsoring gov-\nernnments. Mr. Hickerson declared that Mr. Dunn and himself had\nbeen at a loss as to what reply to give the Italians. A most important\nconsideration was the fact that, despite many disagreements, the\nItalo-American groups in this country were in complete agreement\nthat Italy should be invited to the Conference. These groups were\nrepresented at the Conference by Mr. William Allen of the A. F. of L.\nMR.
