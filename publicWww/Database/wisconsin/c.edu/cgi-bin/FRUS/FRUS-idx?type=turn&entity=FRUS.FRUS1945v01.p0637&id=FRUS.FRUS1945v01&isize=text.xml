General : the United Nations\n\t\t\t(1945)\n\n The United Nations conference on international organization, San Francisco, California, April 25-June 26, 1945,&#160;&#160; pp. 1-1432\n\t\t\t\n PDF (565.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 575\n\n\n                  UNITED NATIONS C0ONFERENCE                  575\ning Governments on proposed amendments to the- Dumbarton Oaks\nProposals.79  THE SECRETARY proposed that M. Bidault be invited\nto attend the meetings of the Big Four and pointed out that these\nmeetings would probably not continue very much longer inasmuch as\nthe Executive Committee of the Conference would begin to function\nmore actively and tend to replace the meetings of the Big Four. MR.\nBLOOM asked whether this meant that M. Bidault would participate\nin the meetings and THE SECRETARY replied in the affirmative. THE\nSECRETARY stated, in reply to Mr. Armstrong\'s question, that the Spon-\nsoring Governments would be consulted before an invitation was ex-\ntended. SENATOR CONNALLY. stated that he had no objection to the\nproposal but that he didn\'t like it.\n        RELEASE OF SPONSORING GOVERNMENTS AMENDMENTS\n  THE SECRETARY raised the question whether or not it was wise to\npresent a united front among the Big Four on the proposed amend-\nments to the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals and suggested that it might\nbe better to introduce such amendments separately in the Commissions\nand Committees. MR. PASVOLSKY pointed out that it was impossible\nto follow that procedure because all formal proposals had to be sub-\nmitted to the Secretary-General by midnight, Friday, May 4. MR.\nPASVOLSKY also stated that the proposed amendments could not be\nsubmitted separately because they had been worked out jointly among\nthe Big Four. MR. BOWMAN suggested that one way of explaining\nthe matter would be to suggest that the Sponsoring Governments had\nconsulted together on the proposed amendments in order to expedite\nthe work of the Conference.\n  THE SECRETARY asked the Delegation to review the following Draft\nCovering Statement for Joint Submission to the Conference of Amend-\nments Agreed by the Four Nations:\n  "The United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and\nChina have consulted together concerning the amendments to the\nDumbarton Oaks Proposals which they wish to propose for consider-\nation by the Conference. They have agreed upon the amendments\nannexed hereto as their joint proposals to the Conference.\n  "These governments will give full consideration to proposals and\namendments submitted by other countries as they come before the\nCommissions and Technical Committees of the Conference."\n79 In telegram 1, May 4, not printed, Secretary Stettinius informed the Acting\nSecretary of State as follows: "A long somewhat stormy but on the whole\nfriendly conversation ensued. Essentially Bidault insisted that France be\nasso-\nciated from now on with the Four-Power discussions on amendments, stating\nthat public and official pressure in France was such that if this were not\ndone\nhe would undoubtedly be recalled, leaving the representation of France at\nthe\nConference to technical advisers without authority. I agreed to bring this\nmat-\nter up at once with the other three Foreign Ministers and not only to introduce\nbut to support fully the French request that Bidault be included in further\nBig\nFour discussions on Conference matters."
