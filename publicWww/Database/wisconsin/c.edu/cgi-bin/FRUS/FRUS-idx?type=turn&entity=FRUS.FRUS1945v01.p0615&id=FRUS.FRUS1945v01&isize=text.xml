The point in Paragraph 3 is that\nif there is a dispute and there is a settlement of that dispute it should\nbe by peaceful means. Paragraph 4 is broader in scope, but it is\nthe reverse of Paragraph 3 in that it provides that member states\nshall refrain from the threat or use of force. Paragraph 4 is appli-\ncable to all situations and not merely to disputes. There might be\nunilateral action in connection with which force or threat of force\nmight be implied. Paragraphs 3 and 4 complement each other and\nParagraph 4 in addition carries us a little further than Paragraph 3\nbecause it relates not only to situations in which a dispute exists,\nbut to any situation in international relations.\n  Mi. MOLOTOV suggested that the word "international" be inserted\nbefore the word "disputes" in Paragraph 3. He did not see any\nreason for further change in this paragraph as it seemed to him\nthat Paragraphs 3 and 4 taken together covered all that had been\nsuggested. They cover cases in which there are disputes as well\nas cases in which there are no disputes.\n  MR. DuJLLEs suggested that we assume a claim is made upon the\nSoviet Union-does the Soviet Union undertake to submit that claim\nto international arbitration? He did not think that was the intent\nof the provision. What was intended was that a nation should not\nresort to force and violence as a means of settling their disputes.\n  MR. MoLoTov repeated that Paragraphs 3 and 4 covered all cases.\nMR. EDEN said that he would be quite content with Paragraph 3 as\nit stands. DR. SOONG said that he felt that the original text was\nall right.\n  SENATOR VANDENBERG said that he would like to know how impor-\ntant Mr. Dulles thinks this matter is. MR. DuLLEs replied that he\nthought that the language as it stands would probably be interpreted\nin the sense of the suggestion the United States had made. Per-\nsonally he would be willing to accept the language as it is.\n  MR. MOLOTOV indicated his agreement. Paragraph 3 was therefore\naccepted with the addition of the word "international".\n  MR. PASVOLSKY said, with reference to Paragraph 5 of Chapter II.\nthat there had been some misunderstanding about this paragraph\nwhich could easily be corrected by a drafting change. He said it\nmight be necessary to clarify the meaning by making the paragraph\nread somewhat as follows: "all members of the organization shall\ngive every assistance to the organization in accordance with the pro-\nvisions of the Charter". DR. SOONG and MR. MOLOTOV indicated\nagreement.\n  No changes were suggested in Chapter III or Chapter IV.\n  MR. SIMrNIUS said that the changes which had been tentatively\nsuggested by the United States on Chapter V, Paragraphs 1 and 2\nhad been withdrawn by the United States Delegation.
