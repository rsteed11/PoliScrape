Conference at Quebec, 1944\n\t\t\t(1944)\n\n Proceedings of the conference,&#160;&#160; pp. 295-384\n\t\t\t\n PDF (32.5 MB) \n\n\n\nPage 345\n\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE\nhoped that the President would agree that during the war with Japan\nwe should continue to get food, shipping, etc., from the United States\nto cover our reasonable needs. The President indicated[ assent.\n  He hoped also that the President would agree that it would be\nproper for Lend,/Lease munitions to continue on a proportional basis\neven though this would enable the United Kingdom to set free labour\nfor re-building, exports, etc., e.g., if British munitions production were\ncut to three-fifths, U.S. assistance should also fall to three-fifths. The\nPresident indicated assent. Mr. Morgenthau however suggested that\nit would be better to have definite figures. He understood that muni-\ntions assistance required had been calculated by the British at about\n3&#8225;/2 billion dollars in the first year on the basis of the strategy\nen-\nvisaged before the OCTAGON Conference. The exact needs would have\nto be recalculated in the light of decisions on military matters reached\nat the Conference. The non-munitions requirements had been put at\no billion dollars gross against which a considerable amount would be\nset off for reverse Lend/Lease. The President agreed that it would be\nbetter to work on figures like these than on a proportional basis.\n  The Prime Minister emphasized that all these supplies should be on\nLease/Lend. The President said this would naturally be so.\n  The Prime Minister pointed out that if the United Kingdom was\nonce more to pay its way it was essential that; the export trade, which\nhad shrunk to a very small fraction, should be re-established. Nat-\nurally no articles obtained on Lend/Lease or identical thereto would\nbe exported; 2 but it was essential that the United States should not\n  2 On the source text the words "or sold for profit" have been\ninserted betw e(-n\nthe word "exported" and the semicolon. The words "or sold"\nare clearly ill\nRoosevelt\'s handwriting, and the words "for profit" may be in his\nhandwritliir\nalso. (Morgenthau told members of his staff in Washington on September 19\nthe t\nthe "President wrote in his own handwriting that they couldn\'t export\nor sell\nfor profit". See Morgenthau Diary, vol. 772.) The change is initialed\nin the left\nmargin by both Roosevelt and Churchill and in the right margin by Churchill\nonly.\n  It is not entirely clear exactly when the words "or sold for profit"\nwere added\nto the text. From Morgenthau\'s diary entry for September 115 (post, p. 361),\nit\nwould appear that Roosevelt suggested inserting all four words during his\nmeet-\ning with Churchill which began at noon on September 15. From an explanation\nwhich Morgernthau gave to a group of American officials in Washington on\nSep-\ntember 20, however, it would appear that the words were added in two stages\nand\nthat Morgenthau "went back" to the President twice regarding them.\nThe ver-\nbatim report of this explanation is as folloi is:\n  "[MORGENTHAIU:] They added \'or sold\'-that was the President. Then\nI had to\ngo back the second time and say, \'for profit,\' and that was the President.\n  "MR. CURRIE: He meant that, \'or commercially.\'\n  "H. M. JR.: No, we told them they could sell. What they were trying\nto get-\nthis was the President\'s contribution-he didn\'t want this stuff the President\nsaid politically it would be unwise. He first staid \'identical thereto ,x)ould\ni)e ex-\nported.\' They asked him what he meant. He said \'exported or sold.\' That wasn\'t\nclear. Then he said, \'exported or sold for profit.\' That wasn\'t clear. Tbv-y\nwxanted\nme to [go] back a third time and I refused to. I said we would exclhange\nletters\non it. I said we wanted them to continue as they have in the past, but I\nwouldn\'t\ngo back a third time." (Morgenthau Diary, vol. 773)\n  For the letter which Cherwell wrote to Morgen-i 1U at Quebec on September\n16,\n1944, to clarify this matter, see post, p. 395.\n\'DA r\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Top of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n&#160;Contents&#160;\n&#160;Section&#160;\n&#160;Page&#160;\n&#160;\n\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this material is in the public domain.| For information on re-use see: http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/Copyright\n\n\nContent/Navigation Questions\nTechnical Assistance\nUniversity of Wisconsin Digital Collections\nAccessibility Information\n\n\n \n&#169; This compilation (including design, introductory text, organization, and descriptive material) is copyrighted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.\nThis </bodyText><pdf><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value></pdf><name /><urls><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Search.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Browse.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Copyright.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/Help.html</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0405&amp;isize=S</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0405&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0405&amp;isize=L</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0405&amp;isize=XL</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=gallery&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0405&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;posn=curr&amp;curr=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0405&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0405&amp;isize=M</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0404&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0406&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.eduhttp://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1944/reference/frus.frus1944.i0012.pdf</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=header&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0011&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&amp;did=FRUS.FRUS1944.i0013&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0355&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0404&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value><value>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0406&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;isize=text</value></urls><id>http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944.p0405&amp;isize=text</id></item>'
