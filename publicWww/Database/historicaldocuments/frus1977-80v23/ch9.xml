348. Memorandum From the President&#8217;s Assistant for National Security

                                Country File, Box 45, Folder: Latin America, 1&#8211;8/77. Confidential.
                                Sent for action. Printed from an uninitialed copy. Although no
                                drafting information appears on the memorandum, Pastor forwarded a draft to
                                Brzezinski on April 26, noting that it had been &#8220;written in response
                                to your request for short three-five page, medium to long-term,
                                political and/or economic analyses.&#8221; &#8220;As you may recall,&#8221; he added,
                                &#8220;you approved my request to write an analysis on the Caribbean in
                                late-February, but only now have I had the opportunity to write it.
                                In some ways, the time for such an analysis is not only opportune,
                                but urgent. The other day, I heard that Ray Marshall and Griffin Bell are apparently proposing a $100 million
                                plan for the Caribbean to deal with the illegal alien issue in just
                                the piecemeal and haphazard manner which I criticize directly in my
                                paper.&#8221; In a marginal comment, Inderfurth suggested circulating the memorandum to
                                    &#8220;Hormats and Hansen before submission to the
                                President.&#8221; Aaron agreed and
                                instructed Inderfurth to
                                &#8220;return to Pastor and
                                circulate.&#8221; (Ibid.) Hansen&#8217;s
