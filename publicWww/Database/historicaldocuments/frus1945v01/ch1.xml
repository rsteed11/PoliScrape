Introductory note by the Editor
Historical Note

For documentation on arrangements for exploratory discussions on world
                        security organization (including the Dumbarton Oaks conversations August
                        21&#8211;October 7, 1944), see Foreign Relations, 1944, volume I, pages 614 ff.
The Conference of the United Nations was called to meet in San Francisco on
                        April 25, 1945, for the sole purpose of drafting the charter of a world
                        security organization, and concluded on June 26, 1945, after fifty-one days
                        of debate, negotiation, and drafting. The delegates of fifty governments
                        unanimously approved the Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the
                        International Court of Justice, and the &#8220;Interim Arrangements&#8221; for the
                        establishment of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in plenary
                        session on June 25. On the following day the Charter was signed by 153
                        delegates, and a space was left for the signature of Poland, whose
                        government was not represented at the Conference.
The United States Senate gave advice and consent to ratification of the
                        Charter of the United Nations and annexed Statute of the International Court
                        of Justice on July 28. President Truman ratified the
                        Charter with the Statute on August 8 and signed the United Nations
                        Participation Act of 1945 providing for United States participation in the
                        United Nations on December 20. The Charter came into force on October 24,
                        1945, when the five major powers and twenty-four other signatory states had
                        ratified the Charter. The original Protocol of Deposit of Ratifications of
                        the Charter of the United Nations, signed by Secretary of State
                            James F. Byrnes, was deposited, with the original
                        signed copy of the Charter and the Statute, in the Archives of the
                        Government of the United States.
Conference Structure and
                            Documentation

The Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, supplemented by later agreements, amendments,
                        comments, and proposals submitted by participating [Page 2]governments, constituted the agenda of the Conference. The
                        permanent organization of the Conference comprised four commissions, twelve
                        technical committees, and four general committees. The International
                        Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General of the Conference, provided
                        secretaries and clerical assistance for the committees, as well as
                        translating, documentation, communications, and other facilities for them
                        and the Conference as a whole.
The Charter was drafted in closed meetings of the twelve technical committees
                        and their subcommittees. Recommendations of each committee formulated on the
                        various parts of the agenda assigned to it were submitted on completion of
                        its work to the appropriate commission, and, in turn, each commission, after
                        consideration of the recommendations of its technical committees,
                        recommended to the Conference in plenary session proposed texts for adoption
                        as parts of the Charter. Nearly all of the important records of the
                        Conference were issued in mimeographed form and distributed daily. About
                        half a million sheets were reproduced each day. Documents of the commissions
                        and committees, in general, include agenda, summary reports of meetings, and
                        working documents. Verbatim minutes of the plenary sessions only were freely
                        distributed, although verbatim minutes of other meetings were available for
                        reference.
The principal documents of the United Nations Conference were published by
                        the United Nations Information Organizations (London and New York) in
                        cooperation with the Library of Congress in the 22-volume series entitled
                            Documents of the United Nations Conference on
                            International Organization. The series is available from the United
                        Nations, New York. This material, reproduced photolithographically, without
                        textual editing, from the mimeographed, printed, or photolithographed
                        originals, is presented in the two working languages of the Conference,
                        English and French. The final documents, however, the Charter, Statute of
                        the International Court of Justice, and the Interim Arrangements are
                        presented in the five official languages, Chinese, English, French, Russian,
                        and Spanish. An index covering the complete official documentation is
                        contained in volume 21. This volume provides a chronological legislative
                        history of each article of the Charter, an alphabetical subject key, tables
                        of correspondence between articles of the Charter of the United Nations and
                        the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, and a list of abbreviations used. An
                        explanation of the numbering and classification system for Conference
                        documentation is provided in volume 2 of the series, on pages 19, 27, and
                        31.

Purpose and Scope of This
                        Compilation

This compilation constitutes a bridge between the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals
                        and the Charter of the United Nations. It concentrates on the role of the
                        United States in establishing the legal framework of the United Nations
                        Organization.
The underlying purpose is to present the American Delegation&#8217;s position in
                        relation to the various issues, discussions, and decisions at different
                        levels, such as informal diplomatic meetings, in Conference committees and
                        subcommittees, and informal meetings of individuals, with emphasis on the
                        why and how, and the atmosphere in which agreements were reached informally
                        among the major Powers on the various issues, rather than on what transpired
                        in the formal meetings of the Conference.
The preparation of United States policy recommendations for a general
                        international organization is traced chronologically from the first of the
                        year to completion on May 2, 1945, and issuance in the documentary form of
                        &#8220;Changes in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals as Suggested by the United States
                        Delegation&#8221;, and on May 4 in the form of &#8220;Amendments Proposed by the
                        Governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and
                        China.&#8221;
Substantive work of the Conference, which awaited availability of the joint
                        proposals of the Sponsors, began on May 7 with study of the Dumbarton Oaks
                        Proposals and the amendments presented by the Sponsors and other nations at
                        the Conference. From this point on to [Page 4]the signing of the Charter on June 26, the documentation presented herein
                        focuses on four phases of Conference activities: policy development,
                        negotiation, debates, and drafting. The evolution of United States policy on
                        the various subjects may be traced through the minutes of the seventy-nine
                        meetings of the United States Delegation. Informal negotiation outside
                        formal meetings, and coordination of proposed policies of the United States
                        with other major powers, may be traced through minutes of the twelve
                        meetings of the &#8220;Big Four&#8221; and twenty-nine meetings of the &#8220;Big Five&#8221;, as
                        well as minutes of a series of informal meetings with representatives of the
                        other American Republics. This documentation, unpublished heretofore, is
                        coordinated with the published documentation on Conference proceedings by
                        use of footnote citations at the appropriate points in order to trace action
                        taken by the American delegates in the various technical committees of the
                        Conference in accordance with the agreed position established within the
                        delegation as a whole for their guidance.
Many of the records of meetings included in this volume were informal notes
                        rather than official verbatim minutes approved by the participants.
Additional selected documentation printed herein includes extracts from the
                        daily record of Secretary of State Stettinius, memoranda of conversations of the Secretary with
                        other delegates, daily reports of the Secretary to the Department on
                        Conference developments, instructions to the Secretary from the Department,
                        Departmental correspondence, memoranda, diplomatic notes, policy statements,
                        and Presidential correspondence.
Occasional deletions of less important data have been made, necessarily,
                        within certain documents to save space but not without indications in the
                        text.
The documents were gathered from the central indexed files and the office and
                        post lot files of the Department of State, as well as from the Manuscript
                        Division of the Library of Congress, from the Department of the Interior,
                        from the United States Mission to the United Nations, from the
                            Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park, New
                        York, and from various Department of State publications.[Page 5]
